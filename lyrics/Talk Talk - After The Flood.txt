Sang soulless loud
Herding step on flesh
And nothing else
To well
To drown and drown
Sleight of reason
How they come
Cain in number
Alone
The crowd
Spurning step by static
Blame something else
Thirsting
Within without
Sighted
Weeded
How they run
Slain in number

Shake my head
Turn my face to the floor
Dead to respect
To respect to be born
Lest we forget who lay
