The One You Really LoveThe Magnetic FieldsI do believe our love's in dangerI might as well be loving airYou look at me like I'm a strangerYou look at me like I'm not thereI gaze into your eyes of blueBut their beauty is not for meYou're thinking on someone who's goneYou're dreaming of the one you really love I made you mine, or so it seemedThough he is dead he haunts your dreams I might as well be two foot tallYou never will love me at all...I gaze into your eyes of bluebut their beauty is not for meYou're thinking on someone who's goneYou're dreaming of the one you really love You're dreaming of the corpse you really love[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:The_One_You_Really_Love ]
