I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which was standard for me
Thursday, 12:30, I got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rearview mirror, but in its reflection
Just for a second, I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories of what I had learned, stopped me in my tracks
Who was that? it was my lover, my lover, from a past life

From a past life (feel like I saw a ghost)
From a past life (so unexpected)
From a past life (I was transfixed)
From a past life

Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic so I'd say, like a bizarre chick flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to block out a friend, but it was real
It just feels like a past life

From a past life (crazy)
From a past life (it takes a lot to trip me out)
For the first time
In a long time

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
(I guess there's no harm in trying)
From a past life
(What's the worst that could happen?)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life (you're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
For the first time (I know it's late, it just didn't feel right)
In a long time

Hello?
