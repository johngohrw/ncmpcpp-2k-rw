Mother Goose
Never should haver ever let that Jack get loose
But that little boy blue
Keeps messing all the things he gets his hands into

Now look what you've done
Stuck in your thumb, pulled out a plum

Mama says, "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Mama says "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny

Jack and Jill
Went up and down and up and fooled around the hill
Now only time will tell
How late the rabbit will arrive in wonderland

Now look what you've done
Stuck in your thumb, pulled out a plum

Mama says, "Boys will be boys"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
Daddy says "Don't need no birth control"
That's Li'l Jack Horny
