I'm the hard looser
You'll find me crashing through my mother's door
I am the ugly lover
You'll find us rolling on the dirty floor

Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones  [3x]

I'm a belly dancer
I'll shake forever and I'll never care
I'm a building jumper
Roof to roof you see me flying in the air

Break my body, hold my bones, hold my bones  [3x]

Somebody got hurt
Somebody get hurt
Somebody got her
