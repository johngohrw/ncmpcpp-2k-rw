Did you ever wake up to find
A day that broke up your mind
Destroyed your notion of circular time
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway
It's just that demon life has got you in its sway
Ain't flinging tears out on the dusty ground
For all my friends out on the burial ground
Can't stand the feeling getting so brought down
It's just that demon life has got me in its sway
It's just that demon life has got me in its sway
There must be ways to find out
Love is the way they say is really strutting out
Hey, hey, hey now
One day I woke up to find
Right in the bed next to mine
Someone that broke me up with a corner of her smile, yeah
It's just that demon life has got me in its sway
It's just that demon life has got me in its sway
It's just that demon life has got me in its sway
It's just that demon life has got me...
It's just that demon life has got me...
