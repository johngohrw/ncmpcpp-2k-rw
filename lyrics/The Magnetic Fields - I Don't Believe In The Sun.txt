I Don't Believe In The SunThe Magnetic FieldsThey say there's a sun in the sky But me, I can't imagine why There might have been one Before you were gone But now all I see is the nightSo I don't believe in the sun How could it shine down on everyone And never shine on me?How could there be Such cruelty?The only sun I ever knew Was the beautiful one that was you Since you went away It's night time all day And it's usually raining, too So I don't believe in the sun How could it shine down on everyone And never shine on me?How could there be Such cruelty?The only stars there really are Were shining in your eyes There is no sun except the one That never shone on other guys The moon to whom the poets croon Has given up and died Astronomy will have to be revisedI don't believe in the sun How could it shine down on everyone And never shine on me?How could there be Such cruelty?[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:I_Don%27t_Believe_In_The_Sun ]
