Now that I fell into your arms
My only lover
Give out to give in
I search for the capsule I lost

Drag me to hell
In the valley of The Dalles
Like my mother
Give wings to a stone
It's only the shadow of a cross

I slept on my back
In the shade of the meadowlark
Like a champion
Get drunk to get laid
I take one more hit when you depart

I'll drive that stake through the center of my heart
Lonely vampire
Inhaling it's fire
I'm chasing the dragon too far

There's blood on that blade
Fuck me, I'm falling apart
My assassin
Like Casper the ghost
There's no shade in the shadow of the cross
