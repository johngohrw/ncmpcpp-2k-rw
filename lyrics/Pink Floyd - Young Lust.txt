I am just a new boy 
A stranger in this town 
Where are all the good times 
Who's gonna show this stranger around? 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl 
Will some woman in this desert land 
Make me feel like a real man 
Take this rock and roll refugee 
Oooh Babe set me free 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl. 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty woman 
Ooooooooh I need a dirty girl.
