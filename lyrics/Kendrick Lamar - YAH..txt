I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah

Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest news is my niece, she's worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream, "That's Uncle Kendrick"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'ma Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin called Duckworth
Said, "Know my worth"
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah
