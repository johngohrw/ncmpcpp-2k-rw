Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream 
I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been 
To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen 
They talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed 

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear 
But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear 
Oh, oh. 

Oh, I been flying... mama, there ain't no denyin' 
I've been flying, ain't no denyin', no denyin' 

All I see turns to brown, as the sun burns the ground 
And my eyes fill with sand, as I scan this wasted land 
Trying to find, trying to find where I've been. 

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream 
Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream 
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again 
Sure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir. 

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years 
With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear 
Ohh. 

When I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah 
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah 

Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down... 
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, well I'm down, so down 
Ooh, my baby, oooh, my baby, let me take you there 

Let me take you there. Let me take you there
