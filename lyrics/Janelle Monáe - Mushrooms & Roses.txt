Mushrooms and roses is the place to be
(Smells like love to me)
Where all the lonely droids and lovers have their wildest dreams
(It's the sound of theâ€¦)
The golden door of our emotions opens here
We're all virgins to the joys of loving without fear

Come sweet love
Take my hand
Follow me
Just let me be
Come sweet love
Just take my hand
Follow me
Let us be
Yeah...

I remember one of the regulars
Her long, grey hair
Beautiful smile and rosy cheeks
Her name slips my mind...
Ahhh, her name was...

Blueberry Mary, and she's crazy about me
(She's so crazy about me)
She's wild man, she's wild!
She gives the boys all of her kisses and electricity
(Til I come, til I come in her dreams)
The golden door of their emotions opens wide
Here they fall into her love and never have to hide

Come sweet love
Take my hand
Follow me
Just let us be
Come sweet love
Just take my hand
Follow me
Let us be
Yeah...
