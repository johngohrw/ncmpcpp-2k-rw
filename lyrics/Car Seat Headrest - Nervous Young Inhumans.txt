You should've seen my cursive back then
Every letter was above the line
My p's and q's raised their stems
So nothing crossed beneath
I'm a little better now

You galvanistic young boy
You galvanistic young man
You galvanistic young inhuman
You understand

Art gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves

Most people are jokes but you're so real
Most of the time that I use the word"you"
Well you know that I'm mostly singing about you

You swore you'd never use
The face that your ex invented
So let's meet up in
Uncanny valley

You galvanistic young boy
You galvanistic young man
You galvanistic young inhuman
You understand

You'll get what you want and you'll get what you deserve

Earlier in the song Will used the term "galvanistic".  Galvanism is the concept... the obsolete scientific theory that there is a kind of electricity flowing through our bloodstreams and that was our life force.  Will used the term because he came across it in Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley.  And that book is sort of an exploration of the theme of creating a character, or making up a person.  So Will used the term "galvanistic" to allude to that book, as a sort of symbol of how he, like, created ME as a character, and he's pretending that he knows a lot more about ME than he actually does.  And also to refer to the fact that he's fallen in love with the characters I'VE created in, uh, MY body of work... this is the part of the song where Will starts to regret writing it
