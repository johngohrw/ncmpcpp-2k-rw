If I die before I get it done
Will you decide
Take my words and turn them 
Into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago
I knew not to deprive

It's safe out there and now you're everywhere
Just like the skies
You are love you are the love supreme
You are the rise
And when you hear this
You'll know it's your jam
It's your goodbye

[Chorus:]
Like I said 
You know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

We all crossed when we were feeling lost
It's just the tide
Katari cried the day her lover died
She recognized
Because he gave her
A life of real love
It's no surprise

The nights are long
But the years are short
When you're alive
Way back when would never be again
It was a time
It's gonna catch you
So glad I met you
To walk the line

[Chorus:]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes 
To ferry me away
To where we all belong

Come get me
Hey!

Hey!

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

[Chorus:]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong

Let me live
So when it's time to die
Even the reaper cries
Let me die
So when it's time to live
Another son will rise

I said yeah, yeah, yeah
I said yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
(I said yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when the drummer drums
He's gonna play my song
To carry me along
(I said yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
(I said yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
(I said yeah, yeah, yeah)

Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
