Kiss Me Like You Mean ItThe Magnetic FieldsHe is my lord, He is my saviour and He rewards my good behavior My secret soul, I know He's seen it He says, come here baby and Kiss me like you mean it He calls me babySays kiss me like you mean it He is my life and my salvation He's always rightHe's always patient I pinch myself It's like I'm dreaming it... He says, come here baby and Kiss me like you mean it He calls me babySays kiss me like you mean it He is my love, He's always been it...[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Kiss_Me_Like_You_Mean_It ]
