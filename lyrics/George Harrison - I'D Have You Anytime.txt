Let me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me roll it to you

All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms
I'd have you anytime

Let me say it, let me play it
Let me lay it on you
Let me know you, let me show you
Let me grow upon you

All I have is yours
All you see is mine
And I'm glad to hold you in my arms
I'd have you anytime

Let me in here, I know I've been here
Let me into your heart
