Watched her as she wiped her eyes;
You don't make me sorry. Now I know
That you never listened - Listen.

Thinking about that high school dance
Worrying about the finals
Yes I know
You're feeling lonely
Oh lonely, so lonely.

Never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
Don't worry about it, honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, it won't change now.

Am I wrong?
Don't sing along with me.
I said I was fine,
It's just the second time
We lost the war

She'd be in the kitchen
I would start the fire
Those days are gone
But you know I can't give up - Give up.

P.S. if i may ask why
When will they get tired
We've stayed up
All night tryin' - Tryin'.

Never needed anybody, I never needed nobody
I never needed anybody, I never needed anybody
Don't worry about it, honey
I never needed anybody
I never needed anybody, it won't change now.

Am I wrong?
Don't sing along with me.
I said I was fine.
The second time
We lost the war
