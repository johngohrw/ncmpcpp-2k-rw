When I was young and stupid my love
Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me please don't worry
Wise little smile that spoke so safely

He booked a one way ticket
Out west that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches

He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwan

He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion

Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Superparadise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost

When I was from n.o.l.a no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby

I miss him don't you blame me
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dreams

I know you don't but I
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder shook him down
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I
That girl is gone but I still try
I think it's over now
The bullet hit but maybe not
I feel so fucking numb
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong
My body's looking wrong

Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Superparadise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
