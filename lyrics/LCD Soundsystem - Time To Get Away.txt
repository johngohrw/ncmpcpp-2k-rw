Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
You brought a lot of money
But me, I got a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you're under my knee
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)
And so its time to get away, Its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time we'll talk it over
And we can start again
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
Ah-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time let's talk about it
And maybe start again
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
(You know what I'm saying?) I knew you were low man,
But the truth is I was shocked
(Of) power eyes, eyes never lie
Kids, Kids never lie.
