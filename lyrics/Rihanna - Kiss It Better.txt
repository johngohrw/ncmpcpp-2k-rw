Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Been waiting on that sunshine
Boy, I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but you take me back
Who cares when it feels like crack?
Boy you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride, just take it on back, boy
Take it on back boy, take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting vibe, man, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

[Chorus:]
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Been waiting on that sunshine
Boy, I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gonna get it like that
So why are you, you here? Here to take me back?
Who cares when it feels like crack?
Boy, you know that you always do it right
Man, fuck your pride, just take it on back, boy
Take it on back boy, take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting vibe, man, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

[Chorus:]
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

I've been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me what's wrong
Gonna make it right
Make it all night long
I've been waiting up all night
Baby, tell me what's wrong
Go on and make it right
Make it all night long
Man, fuck your pride, just take it on back
Just take it on back bae, take it back all night
Just take it on back, take it on back
Mmm, do what you gotta do, keep me up all night
Hurting vibe, and it hurts inside when I look you in your eye

[Chorus:]
What are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Oh, what are you willing to do?
Oh, tell me what you're willing to do?
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Kiss it, kiss it better, baby

Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
Kiss it, kiss it better, baby
