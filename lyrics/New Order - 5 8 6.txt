I see danger
On the corner sent by me
Shadows the ways
Straight away you ran from me
I heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
I heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
 
I hear silence
I hear silence in my heart (house)
From a distance
Turn your back and run (hide) from me
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
 
When it happens
You will be no friend of mine
Take the first chance
When I am no longer free
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
 
In the future
When you want me in your heart
I won't be there (help you)
If you call out in the dark
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Oh yes I heard you, heard you, heard you, heard you calling
 
Can you hear me deep inside
From these feelings I can't hide
Can you hear me deep inside
From these feelings I can't hide
Oh, can you hear me deep inside
From these feelings i can't hide
Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me calling you
Can you head me calling you
