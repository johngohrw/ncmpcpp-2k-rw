When the sun goes to bed
That's the time your raise your head
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame you Lalena

Arty Tart la de da
Can your part get much sadder
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame you Lalena

Run you hand thru your hair
Paint your face with despair
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame you Lalena

When the sun goes to bed
That's the time your raise your head
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame you Lalena

Arty Tart Oh so la de da
Can your part ever get, ever get much sadder
That's your lot in life Lalena
Can't blame you Lalena
Oh, Lalena
