My mama told me, ever since I was seven,
Hold your head up high.
My parents toldmy ever since I was eleven,
"Hold your head up high."
They said the answer was to become a dancer,
Hold your head high.
Oh, just like I figured, they're always disfigured
With their heads up high.

Now I'm older, I'm getting so much bolder
With my head up high
Oh, as I figured, just like I figured
Since your head's up high, baby.
Oh, just like I figured,
You know, they was disfigured
Hold your head up high.
You know, they says the answer was to become a dancer
Hold your head high, boy.

Ever since I was a baby on my mama's knee,
Oh, just listened to what everybody told me,
Oh yes I did. But still the answer was to become a dancer,
And hold your head high,
But, just like I figured, they're always disfigured,
They hold their heads up high, Watch out!

Do the dog! Oh, watch out!

And now I'm older, they say I'm so much bolder
Got your head up high.
Oh, and the answer was, hey, to become a dancer,
Head up high.
Well, but just like I figured, they're always disfigured
They got their heads up high.
But the answer was, now, boy, to become a dancer
With your head up high

Head up high,
Head up high...
