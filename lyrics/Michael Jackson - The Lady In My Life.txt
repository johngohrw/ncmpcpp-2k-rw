There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So let me keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinnin' by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you you're the lady in my life

Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
As long as I know you'll be there, girl

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

Stay with me, I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go no where
