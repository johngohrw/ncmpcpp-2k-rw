(i have a prophecy for you) 

cop poet 
pig blood corporate day dream 
delusions and murder fantasies 
no one will suffer when you die 
lives sentenced to eternities of light 

oppression wept 
begging for forgiveness 
an angel carried you to your sentence 
so many had to suffer just to die 
lives sentenced to eternities of light 

i prayed to leave my body 
and become 
an angel's guillotine 
no one should suffer just to die 
lives sentenced to eternities of light
