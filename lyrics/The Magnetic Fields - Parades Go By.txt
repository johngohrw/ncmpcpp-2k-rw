Parades Go ByThe Magnetic FieldsI'll linger hereYour ring upon my finger dearAnd sing till dawnA song of you and me and what and whyFor time is allI have to keep between these wallsAnd half asleepThe days go byA million little nights and days go byAnd I don't mind parades go bySo many beautiful parades go byLeave me behindI'll sit and stareHow could I venture anywhereAnd let the centuries fall where they may but never dieFor I have loved and so I lost the world above beyond the mossThe days go byA million little nights and days go byAnd I don't mind parades go bySo many beautiful parades go byLeave me behind[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Parades_Go_By ]
