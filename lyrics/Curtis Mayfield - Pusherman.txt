I'm your mama, I'm your daddy,
I'm that nigga in the alley.
I'm your doctor when in need.
Want some coke?  Have some weed.
You know me, I'm your friend,
Your main boy, thick and thin.
I'm your pusherman.

Ain't I clean, bad machine
Super cool, super mean
Dealin' good, for The Man.
Superfly, here I stand.
Secret stash, heavy bread,
Baddest bitches in the bed,
I'm your pusherman

Silent life of crime
A man of odd circumstance,
A victim of ghetto demands.
Feed me money for style
And I'll let you trip for a while.
Insecure from the past,
How long can a good thing last?
No, no, no

Got to be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow, now
Pusherman gettin' mellow, y'all

Heavy mind, every sign
Makin' money all the time
My LD and just me
For all junkies to see
Ghetto Prince is my thing
Makin' love's how I swing
I'm your pusherman

Two bags, please
For a generous fee
Make your world what you want it to be
Got a woman I love desperately
Wanna give her somethin' better than me
Been told I can't be nuthin' else
Just a hustler in spite of myself
I know I can break it
This life just don't make it
Lord, Lord, yeah

Got to get mellow, now
Gotta be mellow, y'all
Got to get mellow, now

I'm your mama, I'm your daddy,
I'm that nigga in the alley.
I'm your doctor when in need.
Want some coke?  Have some weed.
You know me, I'm your friend,
Your main boy, thick and thin.
I'm your pusherman.
I'm your pusherman.
I'm your pusherman.
I'm your pusherman.
Lord, Lord
