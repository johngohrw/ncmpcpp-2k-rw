There is a child sleeping near his twin 
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind 
That dark angel he is shuffling in 
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled

The love you lost with her skin so fair 
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair 
Her green eyes blew goodbyes 
With her head in her hands 
and your kiss on the lips of another 
Dream Brother with your tears scattered round the world. 

Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
And nobody ever came... 

Don't be like the one who made me so old 
Don't be like the one who left behind his name 
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine 
Nobody ever came 
Nobody ever... 

I feel afraid and I call your name 
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain 
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another 
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over 

Ah do you meet the one I love 
and smell the one who loves you 
Dream brother, dream brother, dream, dream
dream asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over
