Grandma has got new dentures
To eat the crust on pizza
Been taken out by her daughter
Because she thought she ought'a
The kids are eating snickers
Because they're so delicious
Then there's sticky f1ngers
And mother looses her knickers

[Chorus]
BANK HOLIDAY COMES SIX TIMES A YEAR
DAYS OF ENJOYMENT TO WHICH EVERYONE CHEERS
BANK HOLIDAY COMES WITH A SIX PACK OF BEER
....THEN ITS BACK TO WORK A.G.A.I.N.

Bar-b-que is cooking
Sausages and chicken
The patio is buzzing
The neighbours they are looking
John is down the fun pub
Drinking lots of lager
Girls and boys are on the game
All the high streets look the same

[Chorus]

back to work A.G.A.I.N.

[Chorus]

Bank holiday
