Amazin phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow
The rays that range from Asia way to Rio De Janeiro
A craze you crave? but work today's the day that in a major way
I'll make you say oh look he saved the day and also paved the way (hooray)
Rockin? my crew like razor blades today and days away from now okay, okay
I'm like a laser ray keepin the stains? away
and dangerous ways rappin the phrase that pays
all things just ain't a phase but ageless ways a cagey great displays
yo hey, this ain't a game, so stays awake
cause if you came to play you'll all behave insane
After we change the game it won't reamin the same
(I'll fade away!!!) So make your disc and play this tape in your Camaro
Amazin phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow

The verbal God, I throw a murder all my foe and kill 'em
But learnin all and so I'm gorowing while I'm learnin wit em
Infernal I'll explode returnin out the globe about to blow
Now get up out here yo, see head on out the zones that I patrol
Rock and roll might tear you out the soul like blunts and alcohol
I knock your whole toboggan for a loop and now the doubt will flow
I'm not the pro you wanna knock cause on the real I got the glow
Cosmic flows as I suppose thats how its supposed to be
and got to go!!! How'd ya know? Intuition
I was on the old safe surface figure out your purpose that's impossible
But logic will disturb the thought or focus what its not is all about 
the grow about the kind of onus only god can know
I rock it for the chocolate, for the awkward for the thoughtless
in your home or at your office
I'm your early morning coffee so who got the ball?
We roll with Navajos with double barrels
Amazin phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow
