I still have a flame gun
For the cute, cute, cute ones

And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On a tight ship

I still have a flame gun
For the cute ones
To burn out all your tricks
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On a very tight ship

And I know
In the cold light
There's a very big man
There's a very big man
Leading us into
Temptation

Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me

And he's related to you
He's related to you
He is waiting to meet you

He's related to you
He's related to you
He is dying to meet you

Backhand, role reversal
Where is someone?
Backhand, reversible roles
I know there's someone

I still have a flame gun
For the cute ones
To burn out all your tricks
And I saw your hand
With a loose grip
On such a tight ship

And I know in the cold light
There's a very big man
Leading us into
Temptation

Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me
Jackson, Jesse, I've got a son in me

And he's related to you
He's related to you
He is waiting to meet you

He's related to you
He's related to you
He is dying to meet you

He's related to you
He's related to you
He's related to you
He's nude as the news, nude as the news
Nude as the news, nude as the news
All over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over, all over
You
