Ah caught you smiling at me, That's the way it should be, 
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine. 

Ah all the good times we had, I sang love songs so glad 
Always smiling, never sad, so fine. 

[Chorus]
As we walk down the country lanes, I'll be singing a song, 
Hear me calling your name. 
Hear the wind within the trees, Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me. 

Well if the sun shines so bright, Or on our way it's darkest night 
The road we choose is always right, so fine. 

Ah can your love be so strong When so many loves go wrong 
Will our love go on and on... 

[Chorus]

My, my la de la come on now it ain't too far, 
Tell your friends all around the world, 
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed merle. 
Come on now well let me tell you, 
What you're missing, missing, 'round them brick walls. 

So of one thing I am sure, It's a friendship so pure, 
Angels singing all around my door, so fine. 
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do Spend my natural life with you, 
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine. 

When you're old and your eyes are dim, There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again, 
We'll still go walking down country lanes, I'll sing the same old songs, 
Hear me call your name.
