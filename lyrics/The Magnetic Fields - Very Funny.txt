Very FunnyThe Magnetic FieldsEverybody knows but me, when you go where you shouldn't beEverybody knows but me, where you go when you're feeling freeEverybody knows but meSo you go there for a laugh, you just go to take photographsTo believe that, I'd be daft but yes I think you go for a laughAnd you say, I love you honeyVery funny[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Very_Funny ]
