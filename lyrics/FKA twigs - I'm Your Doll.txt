Stop playing with those other girls
It makes me jealous baby
Why won't you be the only one?
The only one
The only one

Stop playing with those other girls
You know it drives me crazy
I'm feeling like a loaded gun
And when it's done I'm the only one

[Chorus x2:]
I'm your doll
Wind me up
I'm your doll
Dress me up
I'm your doll
Love me rough
I'm your doll
I'm your doll

Complete, I'm here, alone
Just won't be there to hold me to
Look into my eyes, my eyes
Complete, I'm here
I'm here, I'm here
Look into my eyes
And tell me that you're here too

Stop playing with those other girls
You know it drives me crazy
I'm feeling like a loaded gun
And when it's done I'm the only one

[Chorus x2:]
I'm your doll
Wind me up
I'm your doll
Dress me up
I'm your doll
Love me rough
I'm your doll
I'm your doll

I'm your doll
I'm your doll
