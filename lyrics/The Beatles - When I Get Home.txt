Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on, out of my way
Cos I'm gonna see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say
To her

Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight

Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm gonna hold her tight
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again

Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way

Whoa-I, whoa-I
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
