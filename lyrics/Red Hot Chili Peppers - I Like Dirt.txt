Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus:]
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream
Live in a dream

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus]

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go

[Chorus]

Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring
Live in a dream

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go

[Chorus]

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one

[Chorus]

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
