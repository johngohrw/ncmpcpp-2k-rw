talk to me 
and i better not hear a word 
do me baby

i still got one bullet left in my nine 
finna do a love crime

you write me love letters 
with your fathers pen 
if he knew the freaky, freaky things 
that you write with it
is it really wrong 
that i want to be the baby daddy 
is that a love crime, love crime
tell me it's a love crime 

murder murder murder she wrote

murder murder murder she wrote 
love crimes love crimes
murder murder murder she wrote

in the getaway car 
you know i love it when the ride is smooth 
if we ever get caught 
it'd be a long vacation for two
