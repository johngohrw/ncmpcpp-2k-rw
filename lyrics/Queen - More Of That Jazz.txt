If you're feeling tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you're thinking how the days seem long
All you're given
Is what you've been given a thousand times before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more
No more of that jazz

Only football gives us thrills
Rock 'n roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs get on your feet
Lie on the floor
Kinda thinking I've heard that line before
Just more more
More of that jazz
More no more of that jazz
Give me no more no more of that jazz

Oh no matter fool
Get no business hanging around and telling lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can't beat them join them
Fun it
Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round
