The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home
Tonight I've been walking in the rain
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame

Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
Just give me one more, one more chance
One more, one more chance

I will find out wherever you are
Drinking in another club or driving in your car
Walking through empty streets
Stupid fool, that was yours for keeps

Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight

The city is quiet, too cold to walk alone
Strangers in overcoats hurry on home
Tonight I've been walking in the rain
Someone's been talking and I've got the blame

Chained, framed, you know what I mean
Push me in a corner and I'll scream
Just give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance tonight

You're so extreme
I want to take you home with me
Come on, tell me one more time
I don't mind, baby, I don't mind
I don't mind

Just give me one more ...

Push me in the corner and I'll scream ...

One more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance
Just give me one more
One more
One more, one more chance
Give me one more chance, one more chance to-...

I don't mind ...
