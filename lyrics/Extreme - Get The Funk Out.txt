If you don't like what you see here
Nobody wants to take you prisoner
So let me make it nice and clear dear
The exit is right there
I don't mean to be rude dude
But you'd better change your attitude

I don't like what I see here

You're all invited to the party
You know you didn't have to come
No rotten apple gonna spoil my fun

If you don't like what you see here
Get the funk out
We won't try to force feed you
Get the funk out

You can't please everbody
But everybody cannot please me
That's why I do what I want to
So why don't you do, do it to, do it to me, hey
So if you don't like what you see here
You can always leave the country

I don't like what I see here

You're all invited to the party
You know you didn't have to come
No rotten apple gonna spoil my fun

If you don't like what you see here
Get the funk out
We won't try to force feed you
Get the funk out

All I see is pronograffiti
All I hear pornograffiti
It's a monster we all have within us
The American dream
I need more money
I need more money
Just a little more money
Just a little more money
Everybody's got a need
Everybody's got to feed
He man woman hater
He man woman hater
He man woman hater
Dancing to the decadence dance
