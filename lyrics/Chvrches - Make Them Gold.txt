Can you tell me what to have and what to hold
If you never take the weight on your own
No one tells us what is hard and what is fair
And we will deliver once we know where to fall

We are made of our longest days
We are falling but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold

We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold

Can you steady all the hands that you hold
If you never look away from the drum
If you push yourself then I will pull you on
And we will deliver once we know where to fall

We are made of our longest days
We are falling but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold

We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold

I will wait to see if you come at all
To stop us falling out of phase
Let's see if we can keep track of losing days
You smile so wide I can see the signs
Just stop us falling out of phase
I will be with you in the fray
With those second thoughts you asked for
All you asked for

We are made of our longest days
We are falling but not alone
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold

We are made of our smallest thoughts
We are breathing and letting go
We will take the best parts of ourselves
And make them gold
And make them gold
