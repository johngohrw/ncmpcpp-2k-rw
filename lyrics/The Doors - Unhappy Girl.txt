Unhappy girl 
Left all alone 
Playing solitaire 
Playing warden to your soul 
You are locked in a prison 
Of your own devise 
And you can't believe 
What it does to me 
To see you 
Crying 

Unhappy girl 
Tear your web away 
Saw thru all your bars 
Melt your cell today 
You are caught in a prison 
Of your own devise 

Unhappy girl 
Fly fast away 
Don't miss your chance 
To swim in mystery 
You are dying in a prison 
Of your own device
