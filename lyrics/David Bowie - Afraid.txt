I wish I was smarter
I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller 
Things really matter to me

But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone 
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown 
And I'm still so afraid

Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own 
What made my life so wonderful?
What made me feel so bad?
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds 
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile 
If I can talk on television 
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be Be afraid 
Anymore
