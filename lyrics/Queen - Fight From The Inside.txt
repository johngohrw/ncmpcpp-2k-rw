Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing
You think you're gonna set things to rights
You're just another picture on a teenage wall
You're just another sucker ready for a fall

You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside

You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Fight from the inside
Right down the line -

Hey you boy think that you know what you're doing
You think that out in the streets is all free
You're just another money-spinner tool
You're just another fool

You gotta
Fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside

You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Fight from the inside
Right down the line -
