Well you're just 17 and all you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothin'
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-articulate

Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like I'm paralysed
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-articulate
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel

Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
