as loud as hell
a ringing bell
behind my smile
it shakes my teeth
and all the while
as vampires feed
i bleed

prithee, my dear,
why are we here
nobody knows 
we go to sleep
as breathing flows
my mind secedes
i bleed

there's a place
in the buried west
in a cave
with a house in it
in the clay
the holes of hands
you can place 
a hand in hand
in bleed
