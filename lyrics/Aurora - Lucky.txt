When I am down
I lay my hands upon the ground
Then for the thousand's time
I call him in, his earth is mine

Before I make the offering
Remember all the faces that I've seen
The marks have settled on my skin
From all the different places that I've been
That I've been

And I feel light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
And I feel light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive

Fall behind my eyes
Inside my mind it's coming down
And for the thousandth time
I feel too numb to even try

Before I make the offering
Remember all the faces that I've seen
The marks have settled on my skin
From all the different places that I've been
That I've been

And I feel light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
And I feel light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive

I don't know where I am, or where I'll go
Or where to even begin when I know
What lies behind makes no sense in my mind
But I know that it's time to let go

And I feel light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive
And I feel light for the very first time
Not anybody knows that I am lucky to be alive

I'm lucky to be alive
I'm lucky to be alive
