Standing in the gutter
Watch the sun burn all the hours with you
You look right through
Rain causing nostalgia
Only proof it's getting harder with you
I'll wait for you

It's all I ever was
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever wanted
Something to believe in

Changing by the hour
As the stars begin to shower on you
I'm changing too
Waiting this is sour
So your secrets blowing louder on you
I always knew

It's all that ever was
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever wanted

Something to believe in
It's all ever was
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I'll ever be
It's all I ever wanted
Something to believe in
