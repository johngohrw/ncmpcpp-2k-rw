We just wanna party, word

[Hook x2: Slim Jimmy] 
Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
Got enough for everybody, we crankin’ up the volume
Turn the music up louder, get loose and move your body
Get loose and move your body
We crankin’ up the volume

Safe sex and pay checks is what it's all about
Don't forget about
Safe sex and pay checks

[Verse 1: Swae Lee] 
I bought the bar I bought the hoe so a nigga can’t tell me shit
Just pour me up the ace, that cheap shit makes me sick
I even let your bitch keep the gold bottle, gold pack no lifestyle
Came to the club with my dawgs, then we gon’ ball till we fall
OG purp on me, Steve Urkle have a young nigga geeked
These girls they DTF, they drank got them feelin' theyself
This night life shit ain’t new to me, all the bad bitches get loose with me
Say you do this every night you gotta to prove it to me
Say you bout that life you gotta prove it to me

[Bridge:] 
Shot shots shots shots
Now let's fucking party
Shot shots shots shots
Now let's fucking party
Shot shots shots shots
Now let's fucking party
Shot shots shots shots
Now let's fucking party

[Hook x2: Slim Jimmy] 
Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
Got enough for everybody, we crankin’ up the volume
Turn the music up louder, get loose and move your body
Get loose and move your body, we crankin’ up the volume

Safe sex and pay checks is what it's all about
Don't forget about
Safe sex and pay checks

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy] 
Rockstar life, fuck who don't like, fuck it
Party all night, party all night
I came here to have a good time
Good smoke, good vibes, that’s a good life
Somehow I got the sack past security
Now I'm jumpin’ up and down off the Hennessey
Now I'm jumpin’ up and down off the Hennessey
I'll probably wake up in the morning with no memory
Double shots, no chasers
We party hard in the A.M.
Safe sex, no babies, everybody go crazy
Get wasted

[Bridge x2:] 
Chug, chug, chug
Don't stop til’ you get enough
Don't stop til’ you get enough
Don't stop til’ you get enough

[Hook x2: Slim Jimmy]
Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
Got enough for everybody, we crankin up the volume
Turn the music up louder, get loose and move your body
Get loose and move your body, we crankin up the volume

Safe sex and pay checks is what it's all about
Don't forget about
Safe sex and pay checks
