Time to live 
Time to lie 
Time to laugh 
Time to die 

Takes it easy, baby 
Take it as it comes 
Don't move too fast 
And you want your love to last 
Oh, you've been movin' much too fast 

Time to walk 
Time to run 
Time to aim your arrows 
At the sun 

Takes it easy, baby 
Take it as it comes 
Don't move too fast 
And you want your love to last 
Oh, you've been movin' much too fast 

Go real slow 
You like it more and more 
Take it as it comes 
Specialize in havin' fun 

Takes it easy, baby 
Take it as it comes 
Don't move too fast 
And you want your love to last 
Oh, you've been movin' much too fast 
Movin' much too fast 
Movin' much too fast
