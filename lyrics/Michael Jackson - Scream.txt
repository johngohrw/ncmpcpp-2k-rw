[Michael]
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting
So what does it mean
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks

[Janet]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
[Michael]
With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Janet)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
[Both]
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make you just wanna scream

[Michael]
Tired of you tellin' the story your way
It's causin' confusion
You think it's okay

[Janet]
You Keep changin' the rules
While I keep playin' the game
I can't take it much longer
I think I might go insane

[Michael]
With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Janet)
You find your pleasure scandalizin' every lie
[Both]
Oh father, please have mercy 'cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me

Make me wanna scream

[Janet]
"Oh my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice"
[Michael]
"All the injustice"

Police after being wrongly identified as a
robbery suspect. The man was
an 18 year old black male..."

Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme

You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
