Let's Pretend We're Bunny RabbitsThe Magnetic FieldsIf you knew how I long For you now that you're gone You'd grow wings and fly Home to me Home tonight And in the morning sun Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits Let's do it all day long Let abbots, Babbitts and Cabots Say Mother Nature's wrongAnd when we've had a couple'a'beers We'll put on bunny suits I long to nibble your ears And do as bunnies do Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits Let's do it all day long Rapidly becoming rabid Singing little rabbit songs I can keep it up all night I can keep it up all day Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits Until we pass awayLet's pretend we're bunny rabbits Until we pass away[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Let%27s_Pretend_We%27re_Bunny_Rabbits ]
