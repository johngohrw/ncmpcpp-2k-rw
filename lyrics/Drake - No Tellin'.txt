[Hook:]
Envelopes coming in the mail, let her open em'
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly
Keep the blade with me when I go to check a bitch, ain't no' tellin
Yeah, police comin' round' lookin' for some help on a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' bout' my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin'
Ain't no tellin'

[Verse 1:]
Suitcase, I been living outta' suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club going up on a Tuesday
True say, I been going hard but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I gotta blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dog, just bought a island gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you be gettin' but we just never see a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know
Buncha' out of season woman fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe
All the rappers that you vouch for need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it, I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, nah

OVO unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

[Hook]

[Outro:]
I gotta' keep watchin' for Opper's cause' anything's possible, yeah
There's no code in ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like I'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please do not speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago
I'm at a higher place
Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my, take time
Ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'
