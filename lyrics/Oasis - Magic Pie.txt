An extraordinary guy
Can never have an ordinary day,
He might live a long goodbye
But that is not for me to say
I dig his friends, I dig his shoes
But he is just a child with nothing to lose
But his mind 

They are sleeping while they dream
And then they want to be adored
They who don't say what they mean
Will live and die by their own sword.
I dig their friends, I dig their shoes
But they are like a child with nothing to lose
In their minds, their minds. 

But I'll have my way
In my own time
I'll have my say
My star will shine 

Cos you see me I got my Magic Pie
Think of me yeah that was me I was that passer by
I've been and now I've gone. 

There are but a thousand days preparing for a thousand years
Many minds to educate and people who have disappeared
D'you dig my friends? D'you dig my shoes?
I am like a child with nothing to lose but my mind
My mind
