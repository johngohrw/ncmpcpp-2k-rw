Going down to the swamp 
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon 
Well, I'm going down to the swamp 
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon 
You know the hounddog make-a music 
On a summer night under a full moon

Lord, fetch my cane pole mama 
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two 
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama 
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two 
And when the hound dog start barkin' 
Sounds like ol' Son House singin' the blues

[chorus]
Hound dog sing that 
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music 
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music 
When the hound dog starts singin' 
I ain't got them big ol' city blues

Well, hey pretty mama 
Lord, just take that city hike 
Said go ahead pretty mama 
Lord, just take your city hike 
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs 
For the rest of my natural born life

[chorus]
Singing that 
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music 
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music 
Well, I'd rather live with the hounddogs 
For the rest of my natural born life 
Well, I'd wanna live with the hound dogs 
For the rest of my natural born life
