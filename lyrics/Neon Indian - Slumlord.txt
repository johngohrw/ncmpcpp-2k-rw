In the middle of night, in the second sun, every last chance you take
I see that nobody's kids anymore, though we look that way, we're 24, growing' up
Cause it's easy to be the miser when no one's the wiser
Easy to shake it out
Easy to bring the green in various ways
How easy to wear the crown

They say that this place ain't got a heart
Cause I could still hear the beat
And every night is oh-oh-oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah-oh
From all the way down the street

It goes on and on and (as long as you got the money)
On and on and (as long as you got the money)
On and on and (as long as you got the money)
On and on and (Slumlord doesn't care)

Staying at the hallway [?] Saturday, cause you got the rent to pay
Dreams are shelling out next to none with no room again, honey, those days are done
Shelling out three G's, for four walls and keys
Hey, at least you can run the town
Shaking our pockets loose, hey, what's the use?
I guess we're kicking this city down

They say that this place ain't got a heart
Cause I could still hear the beat
And every night is oh-oh-oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah-oh
From all the way down the street

It goes on and on and (as long as you got the money)
On and on and (as long as you got the money)
On and on and (as long as you got the money)
On and on and (as long as you got the money)

It goes on and on and (if you want that money)
On and on and (if you want that money-eh-eh-eh-ey)
On and on and (if you want that money)
On and on and (if you want that money-eh-eh-eh-ey)
