Every thousand years
This metal sphere
Ten times the size of Jupiter
Flies just a few yards past the Earth

You climb on your roof
And take a swipe at it
With a single feather
Did it once every thousand years

Until you've worn it down
To the size of a pea
Yeah, I'd say that's a long time
But it's only half a blink in the place we're going to be

Where you going to be?
Where will you spend eternity?
I'm gonna to be perfect from now on
I'm gonna to be perfect starting now

Stop making that sound, stop making that sound
I will say I forgot it
It was only yesterday
And that's all you had to say
