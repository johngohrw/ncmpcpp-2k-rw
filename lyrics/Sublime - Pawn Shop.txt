Down there at the pawn shop it's only way to shop
down there at the pawn shop if it's not in stone
down there at the pawn shop at no end, no way to shop

down there at the pawn shop what has been told
albino made of stone just remember that it's flesh and bone

so, why I'm down here at the pawn shop
down here at the pawn shop..down here at the pawn shop..down here at the pawn shop
what has been sold, not strictly made of stone
just remember that it's flesh and bone

and I have heard, like dike-a-bird yeah
but just remember that it's flesh and bone
so why I'm down here at the pawn shop..down here at the pawn shop

Go!...right!...huh that's right

down here at the pawn shop it's a nifty way to shop
down here at the pawn shop it's another sold
down here at the pawn shop what has been sold
not strictly made of stone just remember that it's flesh and bone

what has been sold not strictly sold please remember that it's flesh and bone
down here at the pawn shop..down here at the pawn shop

down here at the pawn shop..down here at the pawn shop-yop-yop
