Big beats, black cloud
Get it wrong, get loud
Write a song, get down
And everyone will know
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

Oh, then, get lost
Take a shit, maybe not
Let's sing good, he's fine
Everything you know
And everyone should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I don't know need to know
So, do know you want to?
Am I just right? (Is it just right?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me?
Oh, it is perfect
It could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It's a butterfly who waits for the world

Why don't we get caught?
Quit and sell livestock
Heck, get an old body
Got you moaning slow
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

Big bird, dimming
Wish I could save them
Don't know, no plan
Everyone can go
And nobody can know
And nobody can know

I don't know need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just (am I just?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me?
Oh, baby, it is perfect
It could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It's a butterfly who waits for wind
To fly away

If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
Living in the real world
Looking for a dream girl

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It's a butterfly who waits for the world
To fly away

If you're looking for a dream girl
I'l never be your dream girl
