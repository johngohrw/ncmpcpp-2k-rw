You took me higher from this dark
Out of ordinary love
Now you're changing with the wind
New horizons, born again
Twisted eyes burn through your heart
Slowly tearing us apart
There's nothing left to think or say
We'll never be that way

You're a stranger, a stranger, again
You're a stranger, a stranger not a friend

(Strangers, strangers, strangers)

You keep me hanging, keep me dark
Never let me drift too far
Like a stranger in my wake
Forget this all began

You're a stranger, a stranger, again
You're a stranger, a stranger not a friend

Like a stranger, Like a stranger, Like a stranger
In a different place
Like a stranger, Like a stranger
In a different place, different face

(Stranger, again
You're a stranger, stranger, again)

It feels so wrong
But it feels so right
When you're out of mind
And out of sight

(Feels so wrong but it feels so right
Just another face and thats)

A stranger, a stranger, again
You're a stranger, a stranger not a friend
You're a stranger now, a stranger then
A stranger once again
You're a stranger now
A stranger then
A stranger once again

You walk on by
I'll be dancing again
