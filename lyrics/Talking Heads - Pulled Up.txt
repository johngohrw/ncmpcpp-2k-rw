Mommy, Daddy, come and look at me now
I'm a big man in a great big town
Years ago who would believe it's true
Goes to show what a little faith can do

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!
Pull me up up up up up up up up

I slipped, and I got pulled
Pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,
you pulled me up
I slipped, and I got pulled,
Pulled up, I slipped, and then you pulled,
you pulled me up pull me up pull me up...
Pulled me up up up up up up up up

I drift away to another land
Sleeping dreaming such a simple thing
I think of things that I might be
I see my name go down in history

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so string now 'cause you pulled me up!
Pull me up up up up up up up up
I slipped, and I got pulled,
pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,
you pulled me up
I tripped, and I got pulled
Pulled up, I slipped, and then you pulled
you pulled me up! Pulled me up up, Pulled me up...
Pulled me up up up up up up up up

I got up
'cause you pulled me up
I stood up
'cause you pulled me up
I got up
And that was because you pulled me up
I got up
In a little while you pulled me up
Pull me up up up up, up up up up!
Pull me up up up up up up up up!

I cast a shadow on the living-room wall
Dark and savage with a profile so sharp
Keep that wonderful food on the table
There's really no hurry I'll eat in a while

I was complaining, I was down in the dumps
I feel so strong now 'cause you pulled me up!
Pull me up up up up up up up up!
I slipped, and I got pulled
Pulled up, I tripped, and then you pulled,
you pulled me up
I slipped, and I got pulled
Pulled Up, I slipped,
And then you pulled, you pulled me up!
Pull me up...Pull me up...Watch out!
Pull me up up up up up up up up!
Pull me up up up up up up up up!
Pull me up up up up up up up up!
