You’re no better off, living your life and dreaming at night
This much is true, but it’s still up to you to take my advice

To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

Go home [x4]

You’re better off dead, when your mind’s been set from nine until five
How could it be true, well it’s happened to you, so take my advice

And take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go

Go home [x8]
