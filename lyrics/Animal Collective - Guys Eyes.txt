[Panda Bear's Part (main)]

I really want to do just what my body wants to
I really want to do just what my body needs to
I really want to show to my girl that I want her
I really want to show to my girl that I need her

I really want to do just what my body wants to
I really want to do just what my body needs to
I really want to show to my girl that I want her
I really want to show to my girl that I need her

Need her
I need her

I want to do just what my body needs to
I want to do just what my body needs to
I want to show to my girl that I need her
I want to show to my girl that I need her

So I use my mind
And I use my hand
And watch what I want to

So I use my mind
And I use my hand
And watch what I want to do

What I want to do

What I want.
