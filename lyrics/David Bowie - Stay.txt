This week dragged past me 
so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could 
get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[CHORUS]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, 
make me delight
Right is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is 
stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody 
Wants something or wants to stay 

[CHORUS]
