I had another nightmare
Go back to sleep honey
Everything will be alright in the end
Rock is dead, guitars are dead
In the where are they now category
The Astronauts, with their first big hit Ain't Got Nobody

Ain't got nobody

Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to really love me
Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me

I've been so patient, all around the nation
There ain't no one in all creation

I'm living all alone, nobody at home
I try to fall asleep, I really start to freak

My daddy loved me, no one could touch me
Until he went up and left me lonely
That's human nature, we fail each other
We keep on searching for another

I thought I had a friend, but she was just pretend
She didn't have a soul, nothing I could hold

Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to really love me

Someone I could greet when I come home from work
Someone who would smile and take away the hurt

Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody
Could you be the one to really love me?
Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me
