This is from, this is from
This is from Matilda

Just like Johnny Flynn said
The breath I've taken and the one I must to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand, so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top to toe with her success

Oh, this is from, this is from, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda

Just like Johnny Flynn said
The breath I've taken and the one I must to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand, so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top to toe with her success

Oh, this is from, this is from, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda

Elle aï»¿ besoin de toi,
Cela vient de Matilda

And she needs you, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda
And she needs you, this is from Matilda

This is from Matilda
This is from Matilda
Matilda, Matilda, Matilda
