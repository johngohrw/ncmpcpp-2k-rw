I don't practice Santeria
I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars but I, I'd spend it all.
If I could find that Heina, and that Sancho that she's found.
Well, I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd slap her down.

What I really wanna know, mah baby, mmmm...
What I really wanna say I can't define.
Well, it's love, that I need. Oh...

My soul will have to wait till I get back, to find a Heina of my own.
Daddy's gonna love one and all.
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break and I gotta live it up.
Oh, yeah, uh huh.
Well, I swear that I.

What I really wanna know, ah baby.
What I really wanna say I can't define, got love make it go.
My soul will have to...

[Instrumental break]

Oh...
What I really wanna say, mah baby.
What I really wanna say is I've got mine, and I'll make it, oh yes I'm coming up.

Tell Sanchito that if he knows what is good for him he best go run and hide.
Daddy's got a new Forty-Five.
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat.
Believe me when I say that I got somethin' for his punk ass.

What I really wanna know, mah baby.
Oh, what I really wanna say is there's just one, way back, and I'll make it, yeah.
My soul will have to wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.
