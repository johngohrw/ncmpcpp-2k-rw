When My Boy Walks Down The StreetThe Magnetic FieldsGrand pianos crash together when my boy walks down the streetThere are whole new kinds of weather when he walks with his new beat Everyone sings hallelujah when my boy walks down the street Life just kind of dances through ya from your smile down to your feetAmazing he's a whole new form of lifeBlue eyes blazing and he's going to be my wifeThe world does the hula-hula when my boy walks down the street Everyone thinks he's Petula so big and yet so petite Butterflies turn into people when my boy walks down the street Maybe he should be illegal he just makes life too complete... Amazing he's a whole new form of lifeBlue eyes blazing and he's going to be my wife Oh, shadows of echoes of memories Oh, things that he brings that he found in the sea Oh, shadows of echoes of memories of songs Oh, how could he know that it won't be long...Grand pianos crash together when my boy walks down the street There are whole new kinds of weather when he walks with his new beat Everyone sings hallelujah when my boy walks down the street Life just kind of dances through ya from your smile down to your feet[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:When_My_Boy_Walks_Down_The_Street ]
