Mountains in Kauai
Make me feel so lowly
Cower at their power
Vertical I like
Dizzy under buildings
Bending like their willing
Is it what I’m seeing
Vertical is fright
Hard to gain perspective
Often it’s perplexing
Reaching for a record
Vertical is sight
Hanging on a pylon
Dropping from a million
Jumping hill to hill on
Vertical is height

People live above you
Postured like a totem
Runnin’ up some stairs oh
Vertical is might
Stalling on a nose and
Places to propose in
Seeing everything from
Vertical is light
Diamonds of the sky on
Black and endless background
Reaching out to grab them
Vertical at night
My imagination
Reaches to forever
Like an endless tower
Vertical I write

So high and still it sends a feeling through me
(Oh up above me falling over)
Suddenly not vertical

Breathe in the air the goes through a system that is
(down below me working steady)
Weary when it’s vertical
A tree we are with limbs extending to the sun
(Single holly
Finches calling)
Very lovely vertical

Come find me floating up if you should find me gone
(Nice and
Breezy
Spirits easy)

Did you hear a child say?

My feet can't cross the parking lot
The parking lot is way too hot

Then everything went vertical

At the tips of cities
Birds are tracing columns
Windows bend in wind
Vertical in flight
Down below a statue
People stand in poses
Making good impressions
Vertical delights
Lying on a trunk
And waiting to be dreaming
Startled by a thumpin
Vertical insight
Lots of people thinkin
Thinking about falling
Nothing but a rope so
Vertical hold tight

Sometimes you feel the pressure dropping on you
(Heavy folders
Daring soldiers)
Crashing from the vertical

I start to wonder does this system matter?
(Crumbling boulder
Couldn’t hold her)
Only if it’s vertical

Even in leaves some creatures build themselves a home
(Ancient maples
Empty stables)
Can’t always be vertical

Lifted above the din their worlds a peaceful dome
(Natures diet
Finding quiet)
They don’t hear the child say

My feet won’t cross the parking lot
The parking lot is way too hot

The everything went vertical
