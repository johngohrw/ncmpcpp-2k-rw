Running to and fro, got her hair in a braid, 
Always in a terrible fuss
Tellin' everybody all the friends that she's made
Pushing on the crosstown bus
Always got a dime for the record machine
Never lets the music die
Got the best connections in the city say
Anything you care to buy
Sweet Caroline (Sweet sweet Caroline)
Any day she'll be mine (Sweet sweet Caroline)
Any day now, she'll say that she will (Someday she'll be mine)
Living off the land in a fashionable way
Party every other night
Gets the latest clothes from her friend in the trade
Caroline she does it right
See her on the street as she rushes by
Hard to miss her - yeah you bet
Always on the search for the ultimate end
But she hasn't found it yet
Sweet Caroline (Sweet sweet Caroline)
Any day she'll be mine (Sweet sweet Caroline)
Any day now, she'll say that she will (Someday she'll be mine)
La la la la etc.
