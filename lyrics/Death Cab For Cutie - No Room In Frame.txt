I don't know where to begin
There's too many things that I can't remember
As I disappeared like a trend
In the hum of the 5 in the early morning

And now I'm taking my time
Up through Coalinga through the valley
This highway lived in my mind
It takes me back to the place that made me

Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two

You cannot outrun a ghost
Speeding south bound lanes with abandon
It catches you on the coast
Or on the cliffs of the Palisades you killed the engine

And then it hovers above
Reeling bodies failing to discover
The thing they once knew as love
Raising their voices to convince one another

Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two

And how can I stay
In the sun
When the rain flows
All through my veins
It's true

And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we'll both go on to get lonely with someone else
With someone else

Was I in your way
When the cameras turned to face you?
No room in frame
For two

And how can I stay
In the sun
When the rain flows
All through my veins
It's true

And I guess it's not a failure we could help
And we'll both go on to get lonely with someone else
