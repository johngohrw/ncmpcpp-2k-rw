Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal

We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, we can really begin

Please savior, save your shores
Tell me I'm rapidly yours

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to save us, someone like you
We want you, Big Brother
Big Brother!

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone, and you've been anywhere
Lord, I'd take an overdose, if I knew what's going down

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us - some brave Apollo!
Someone to save us, someone like you

We want you Big Brother
