My mother said to me that I would get in trouble
Our father won't come home cause he is seeing double

Out in the endless green
Your eyes are so misleading
That's when your car pulls up
Its hood is black and gleaming

And in a while
You start a smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time

Wild in our ways
What we are making
Heartless to say
You go, go on pretending

One chance to fall behind the lines that will not let you
Can I believe in how the past is what will catch you

And in a while
You start a smile
The earth is wild
You've got no time
