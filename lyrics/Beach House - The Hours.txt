Can I wait the hours
Till you find me
Climb up to the tower
So that you could see

Violence in the flowers
Where they found you
Can I wait the hours
Would it be untrue
Climb up to the tower
So that you could see
All across the hours

Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't care about me
Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't leave without me
Frightened eyes

Made in your reflection
So that you could feel
Mad in your intentions
Fear it isn't real
All the recollections
Spinning in a field
Left in your possession
Till it isn't real
You say it isn't real

Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't care about me
Frightened eyes
Looking back at me
Change your mind
Don't leave without me
Frightened eyes

Deeper than you and me
It's farther than you could see
Is it too much to ask tell me
It's all in a glance you'll see
It's deeper than you and me
It's all in a glance you'll see
It's farther than we could be
It's deeper than you and me
Frightened eyes
