[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
Family problems, it ain't easy handling those needs
(Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)
Baby mama drama, I just need a little time to go to sleep
(Damn, only if I had a little time for me)
Record company motherfuckers asking me when I'm gonna release
(I want the pressure homie, so much pressure on me)
And my homies on my back about me helping them get up off them streets (I mean what the fuck?)

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
And it all falls back on me
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be

[Dr. Dre:]
(Listen to me)
It's kind of funny how they fall back on me
I used to never get a call back, homie
Before the money they didn't see me like it's dark and it's all black, homie
But now they switching cause the card black, homie
It wasn't always that way
We was recording on the 4-track, homie
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed, living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie

[Justus:]
It was something to me
No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me
Can't always be how you want it to be
And I'm the one that they looking up to
Fuck they expecting from me?

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
And it all falls back on me
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be

[Dr. Dre:]
That's just the way it is, and how it always was
DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day I'm like "what the fuck?"
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's "Fuck the Police" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit
And was like "What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like"
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)
This one of those dreams you don't wake up from
Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from
When the sun shines and they bust nines
Don't dial 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
And it all falls back on me
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
