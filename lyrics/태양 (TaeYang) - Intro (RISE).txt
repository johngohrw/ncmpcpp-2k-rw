Throw ya hands in the air.
Keep ya hands in the air.
We're gonna be reachin' for the sky tonight.
And we're gonna light it up.
Rise tonight.

Throw ya hands in the air.
Keep ya hands in the air.
Put it in the air.
Feel it in the air.
 
Alone in the darkness.
It’s so cold and crazy.
And everybody’s heartless.
Got no one to save me.

But fuck it, imma be all right.
Wake up and rise.
Baby, I’m the one
to light it up
hotter than the burning sun.

Everytime that people say it’s the end, 
I will show I’m forever.
If you can’t see it in my eyes, 
if you don’t recognize, 
then whatever.

Let me say ay!          
Shout it out to the world.  Ay!
Get ready, I'm comin’.
Reachin’ for the sky tonight.
Together, we’re gonna rise with the morning light.

Throw ya hands in the air.
Keep ya hands in the air.
We're gonna be reachin' for the sky tonight.
And we're gonna light it up.
Rise tonight.

Throw ya hands in the air.
Keep ya hands in the air.
Put it in the air.
Feel it in the air.
