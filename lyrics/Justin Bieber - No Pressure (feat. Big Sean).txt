You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'm a put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush, no pressure

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no place to leave
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no

[Big Sean:]
I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the crosslights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush, no pressure

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure
