[Intro:]
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream

[Hook:]
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for 72 hours

[Verse 1:]
God damn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud 9 and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM! I'm racing
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Goddamn I got bitches (okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Verse 2:]
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum imposing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
Damn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga...

[Verse 3:]
It's go time!!!
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you goin' marry mines?"
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (no way)
Beeitch!!! (no way) Beeitch!!! (okay)
I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how
To sell ya game right on time
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!! (go play)
Beeitch!!! (go play) Beeitch!!! I look like OJ
Killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'

[Hook] 
[Bridge]

[Outro:] 
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
