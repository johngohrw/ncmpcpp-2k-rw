Viceroy, early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in and open up my eyes
Viceroy, as it's getting later
Heading for the corner, already running dry

And, oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause, oh honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

Viceroy, don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down just trying to keep it cool
Viceroy, as it's getting later
Heading for the corner, I'm leaving it to you

And, oh, don't let me see you crying
'Cause, oh honey, I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying
