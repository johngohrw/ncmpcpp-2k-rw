I went too far when I was begging on my knees
Begging for your arms, for you to hold them around me
I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
Begging for your love, begging for our eyes to meet

Crying 'give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight.'

I went too far when I was begging on my knees
When I cut my hands, will you just stand and watch me bleed?
I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
Standing in my blood, it was a taste of bittersweet

Crying 'give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight.'

Why can't I turn around and walk away?
Go back in time?
I'll have to turn around and walk away
I can't stay, I have to walk away

An empty heart with an empty hole
And everything I am is gone
I tried to reach for another soul
So I can feel whole

Oh, give me some love
Oh, give me some love

Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight

Why can't I turn around and walk away?
Go back in time?
I'll have to turn around and walk away
I can't stay, I have to walk away

Give me some love...
