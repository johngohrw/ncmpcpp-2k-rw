Papa Was A RodeoThe Magnetic FieldsI like your twisted point of view, Mike I like your questioning eyebrows You've made it pretty clear what you like It's only fair to tell you now That I leave early in the morning And I won't be back till next year I see that kiss-me pucker forming But maybe you should plug it with a beer, cause Papa was a rodeo, Mama was a rock'n'roll band I could play guitar and rope a steer before I learned to stand Home was anywhere with diesel gas, love was a trucker's hand Never stuck around long enough for a one night stand Before you kiss me you should know Papa was a rodeo The light reflecting off the mirror ball Looks like a thousand swirling eyes They make me think I shouldn't be here at all You know, every minute someone dies What are we doing in this dive bar How can you live in a place like this Why don't you just get into my car And I'll take you away I'll take that kiss now, but Papa was a rodeo... And now it's 55 years later We've had the romance of the century After all these years wrestling gators I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me Papa was a rodeo... Before you kiss me you should know Papa was a rodeo What a coincidence, your Papa was a rodeo too[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Papa_Was_A_Rodeo ]
