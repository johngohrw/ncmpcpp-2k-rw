[Slim Jimmy:]
I blow a lot, I chill, I sway, (sway)
How much cash do I make a day, (day)
Enough to brag, enough for tags
Six bands, I drop, Celine, big bags, (bags)
My pants, they bussin'
My bitch, she bluffin', keep lyin' for nothin'
I win, I'm winnin', I walk in Fendi
My head still spinnin' from last night’s Remy
Who got more guap, no flex, boy stop
Push off the lot with all you got
My leather is soft, my top is soft
Can’t speak too boss I dropped the sauce

Swag, swag unlock like I picked it
Twisted fingers gang sign, no picket
PAC, how a youngin’ gonna kick it
Sauced up shorty in here drippin’
Got ya shawty in here strippin’ off shrooms
And THE molly and some weed I got from Dylan
Bout to have a party so you better pay attention
So much Stussy on my body like I'm one of Sean’s children
I said I’m in here high the fuck you think
I said it’s purple inside of all my drinks
I said good gas the label all my blunts they stink like pew
Man I wouldn’t wanna be you I’m in London like a Beatle
Countin’ euros with my people
Rolling up blowing diesel
Been switchin’ up my cash my nigga
Been had Bape on my bag my nigga 
Been had loud blunts on blast my nigga
You know what’s up don’t ask my nigga
I am perfect at picking a piece workin’ and rippin’ a beat
Crew worth a milli at least, money when dealin’ with me
Your girl is leaving with me it’s honestly easy to see
Swag unlocked and you know that I give her the key

[Swae Lee:]
I curve your doobie, then blaze my own
Let's get it some Givenchy, droppin' racks, I'm clumsy
I'm drenched in money, she hate me, she love me
I'm rich, I'm young, I splurge for fun
Care less about your campaign
Enjoy myself, employ myself
Woke up last night, was all a blur
Four Seasons, three words
Do not disturb
