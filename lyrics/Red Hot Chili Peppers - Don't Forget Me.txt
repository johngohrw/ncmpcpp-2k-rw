I’m an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm
Make you want to re-assume
Now we know it all for sure

I’m a dancehall dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall
Up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I’ll be there
Tell me when you want to go

I’m a meth lab first rehab
Take it all off
And step inside the running cab
There’s a love that knows the way

I’m the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of
Everything you’ve ever smelled
Not alone, I’ll be there
Tell me when you want to go

Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
Don’t forget me I can’t hide it
Come again get me excited

I’m an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread
Inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure

I could show you
To the free field
Overcome and more
Will always be revealed
Not alone, I’ll be there
Tell me when you want to go

Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
Don’t forget me I can’t hide it
Come again get me excited

Don’t forget me I can’t hide it
There's a match now let me light it

I’m the bloodstain
On your shirtsleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure

Make the hair stand
Up on your arm
Teach you how to dance
Inside the funny farm
Not alone, I’ll be there
Tell me when you wanna go

I’ll be there and tell me when you wanna go
Come again and tell me when you wanna go
More will revealed my friend…
