Sorry 'bout the things that I had to say
And I'll make it up to you right now at the penny arcade
In an open car or wherever you are
Push yourself too far and it might get hot

Well, I really don't need the confusion
And you know, I just ain't the type
To get all wrapped up in the illusion
Of doin something that I know ain't right, right right

You've got to want to rearrange
And keep it off the record, off the record
You've got to know that we will change
And keep it off the record, off the record, come on

In a crowded room, near the box of boom
To an artificial tune, I see you swoon
Well, you knew all this would turn to mist
If your idea wasn't kissed, why're you so pissed?

Well, I know you don't need the confusion
And I know you just ain't the type
To get all wrapped up in the illusion
Of doing something that you know ain't right, right, right
Right, right, right, right, right

You've got to want to rearrange
And keep it off the record, off the record
You've got to know that we will change
And keep it off the record, off the record

You've got to want to rearrange
And keep it off the record, off the record
You've got to know that we will change
And keep it off the record, off the record, come on
