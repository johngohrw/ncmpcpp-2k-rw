Where does outer space end
It's sort of hard to imagine
Is it real? Is it nothin, nothin?
Cause it's not so clear anymore to me...,

Why do birds always fly south
When sometimes its warm in yer headwound
Is that nothin? Nothin?
Cause its not so clear anymore to me...
And if God hears all my questions
Well how come there's never an answer?
Is it nothin, nothin?
