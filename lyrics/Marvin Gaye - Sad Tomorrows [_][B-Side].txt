Flying High in the friendly sky,
Without leaving the ground,
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits -
And its bound to forsake me.

So stupid minded,
But I go crazy, when I cant find it,

In the morning I'll be alright my friends-
Soon the night - will bring the pains again

Flying hight in the friendly sky,
Without ever leaving the ground,
Aint seen nothing but trouble baby - paraphernalia is my name
Theres a place where the feeling awaits me,
Self destructions in my hands

So stupid minded,
But I go crazy, when I can find it

I know Im hooked my friends,  
To the boy
Who makes slaves out of men...

Ahhh yeah

[The Originals:]
I did the best I could
Nobody understood

Ahhh yeah

I did the best I could
Nobody understood
