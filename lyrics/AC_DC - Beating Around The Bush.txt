Smilin' face and laughin' eyes
But you keep on tellin' me all those lies
How'd you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive
Baby I got my eye on you
Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry you tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears
You can throw me lefts
You can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what was on your mind
Why you bein' so unkind
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talking on the telephone
Thoughts of you goin' throw my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You said that you loved me too
But tell me who was there with you
I was talkin' birds
And you was talkin' bees
And was he down upon his knees
Beating around the bush

Your the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're lookin' for
You've eaten your cake you want some more
I'm gonna give you just one more chance
Try to save our romance
I've done everything
I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you
And you can chew it up
You can spit it out
You can let it all hang out
Beating around the bush

Chew it up
Spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush
