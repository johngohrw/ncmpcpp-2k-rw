The TV lights the room,
Like a strobe against the wall.
I've watched all afternoon without watching at all

I'm thinking of you dear, 
Every moment of the way.
I tied my hands with rope now watch you escape,
And I make no mistake.

There's a demon on the loose,
He's a head under our floor.
Cause I saw him late last night,
Knocking on my bedroom door.

I have surely saved my blood,
Popping through my body's face.
And when I speak I don't make sense,
But believe me when I see.
