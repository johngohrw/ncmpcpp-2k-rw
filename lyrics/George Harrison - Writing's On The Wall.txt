The writing's on the wall brother
Your life is in your hands
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall.

It looks you in the eye mister
It's time we stand up tall
Go see and understand the writing's on the wall.

Strange we hold on to things that have no grace
or power
While death holds on to us much more with every
passing hour
And all the time you thought it would last
Your life, your friends would always be
'Til they're drunk away or shot away or die away
from you.

There's nothing that you need sister
The Lord is in you all
Life is designed to see the writing's on the wall.

The music's in the air mothers
You may have heard it call
To you that you may see the writing's on the wall.

Be careful going home sister
Be watchful down that road
You've got a lot of love sister
More to grow.

The writing's on the wall brothers
Your life is in your hands
It's up to you to see the writing's on the wall
I hope that you may see the writing's on the wall.
