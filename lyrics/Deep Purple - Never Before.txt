Somebody Somebody
Come to my side
I'm tired I'm crying
I'm sick inside
My woman that woman
Just wasn't right

[CHORUS]
Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before

So funny so funny
Just like a show
One name two people
All in a row
Somebody Somebody
Someone must go

[Chorus]

I was hurt when I was younger
By a woman who was cold
She took my name
She took my body
And she threw away my soul

Can't hide I can't hide my misery
I know my sorrow won't set me free
She did it d'you see she did it to me

Help me now please my friend
I never felt so bad before
Never never before
