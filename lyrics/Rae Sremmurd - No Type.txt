[Intro: Swae Lee and Slim Jimmy]
Yah
Bad bitches is the...(Yah)

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I ain't got no type (Nah)
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like (Woo)
You ain't got no life (Nah)
Cups with the ice and we do this every night (Hey)
I ain't check the price (I got it)
I make my own money so I spend it how I like (Woo)
I'm just living life (Hey Hey)
And Let my momma tell it nigga I ain't living right (Yup)

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch I ball like Jordan
And I play full court
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex like you all in the mix?
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies and they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was living like a bachelor

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Spend it how I like (Yah)
Sinning every night (Yah)
Push-start the whip (Hey)
Brought it straight to life (For life)
Blowing on the kush (Blow)
Till I'm out of sight (I won't go)
I don't check the price (Bitch)
All I do is swipe (Woo)
She said, "Whats your type?" (Yah)
I said "I like what I like!" (Yah)
I don't second guess (Nah)
I just roll the dice (Keep it movin')
Keep your two cents (Hey)
Take your own advice (Hey)
I've been living life (Yah)
Like I live twice

[Hook]

[Outro]
I ain't got no type [x2]
And Let my momma tell it nigga I ain't living right
