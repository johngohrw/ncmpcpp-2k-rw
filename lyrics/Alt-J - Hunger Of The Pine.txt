Sleeplessly embracing
Butterflies and needles
Line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it
In my stomach, for my heart
Chain mail

Hunger of the pine
Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour

Hunger of the pine
(I'm a female rebel...)

Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

Realization grew on me
As quickly as it takes your hand
To warm the cool side of the pillow
I'm there for you, be there for me
I'll hum the song the soldiers sing
As they march outside our window

Hunger of the pine

Sleeplessly
Embracing
You

Une immense espérance a traversé la terre
Une immense espérance a traversé ma peur
