A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes

Jealousy in technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Streetlamp amber, wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the skies are sizzling
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong

All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes

She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the skies are sizzling
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
