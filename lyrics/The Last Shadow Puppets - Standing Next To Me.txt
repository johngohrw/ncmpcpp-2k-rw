Want her, have her
Two years have gone now
But I can't relate
To the never ending
Games that you play
As desire passes through
then you're open
To the truth
I hope you understand
And your love
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

The one you fell for 
makes it seem juvenile
And you'll laugh
At yourself
Again and again
And we'll drink
To the thought
She'll remember you
Maybe tomorrow

And your love
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
And your love
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

Want her, have her
Two years have gone now
But I can't relate
To the never ending
Games that you play
As desire passes through
Then you're open
To the truth
I hope you understand

And your love
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
