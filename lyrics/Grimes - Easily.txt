Fly through the night, fly like everyone I know
Like everyone, I've been conceited
Fly through the night, doesn't matter where you go
When you leave, I feel so defeated

Oh, you don't know where you're from
And you got nowhere to go?
Don't taunt me with your story, cause I've got my own
Never better, just less immediate
You come and go, but I love you so (so)

Easily, I'm the sweetest damn thing you ever saw
Easily, suddenly, you don't know me at all
Easily, three years later and now you wanna call
Easily-y-y-y
Easily (so, you)
Easily (so, you)
Easily (so, you)
Easily-y-y-y

(Oh, no-no-no-no-no)

Easily, I'm the sweetest damn thing you ever saw
Easily, suddenly, you don't know me at all
Easily, three years later and now you wanna call
Easily-y-y-y
