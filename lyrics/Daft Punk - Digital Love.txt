Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right
To put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?
