I don't need no one to follow, feathers full
Get up early just to charm unawakened souls
When the sea called me
When the sea called me home

I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!

It's no wonder they're shipping all my clothes
Wear the fog, I'll forget the rules I've known
Look in cloud's mirror
When the sea called me home

I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear!

I hear small words from the shore
No recognized pattern
