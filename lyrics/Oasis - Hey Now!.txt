I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back 

You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me 

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now! 

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame 

The first thing I saw
As I walked through the door
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know
That I want you to know
What is written inside of your head 

And time as it stands
Won't be held in my hands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky
I asked myself why
Can I never let anyone in? 

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now! 

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame 

I hitched a ride with my soul
By the side of the road
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
Down memory lane
I never did find my way back 

You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me 

I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now! 

Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
