Feel a bit roughed up, 
feel a bit frightened
Nearly pin it down some time
Red sail action
wake up in the wrong town
Boy, I really get around

Thunder ocean
Thunder ocean
Red sails take me, 
make me sail along

Red sails, and a mast so tall
Red sails
Red sails

Do you remember we another person
Green and black and red and so scared
Graffiti on the wall keep us all in tune
Bringing us all back home

Red sails
Thunder ocean
Red sails
Sailor can't dance like you

Red sail
Red sail action
Red sail
Some reaction

Action boy seen living under neon
Struggle with a foreign tongue
Red sails make him strong
Action make him sail along
Life stands still and stares

The hinterland, the hinterland
We're gonna sail to the hinterland
And it's far far, far far far, far far far away
Its a far far, far far far, fa da, da da da
1-2-3-4
Ooooooo
