[Anderson .Paak:]
From close range we official
Cocaine, money and pistols
Goddammit I got issues
Can't be serious
Alright now here we go
Where my city at?
Fuck with me, come on
I know you're feelin' that
Fuck with me, come on
You know I'm really that
Fuck with me, come on
Come on, come on
Don't even act like I ain't about my business
Mothafucka come on!
Come on, come on
Full clip, ammunition
You don't wanna deal with these fuckin' consequences

[Ice Cube:]
Fuckboys should tighten up a whole lot
I got some niggas with me down for runnin' up in your spot
And these niggas got hatchets and ratchets
Some of them lethals up under the mattress
And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses
But chances are I might get another negative reaction
They got my fraction but I fucks 'em up like battery acid
Who gives a fuck what you think, nigga? This is my passion
Ride through the time, you know my name, you know my reputation
You know what it is, I don't need to give no explanation
When you say my fuckin' name, add exclamation
Los Angeles king now, make your bitch bring crowns
To me and Dre, you don't like it, you can lay
Think I'm quiet cause I'm actin', but my bank account gon' say
Fuck you! Respected from SoCal out to the Bay
Cashed a lot of checks this mornin', guess today was a good day

[Dem Jointz:]
Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers'll join the fallen

[Dr. Dre:]
But this is what the fuck is up, doin' this for my city
Comp-town, Hub, this my fuckin' committee
Shout out to Dub C, real nigga be with me
C-Walkin' on these niggas with a crease in them Dickies
You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?
Around this time I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark
My CD crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy, man
Fuck the money, yo this shit could never change me, man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day
Just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit
Nigga with an attitude, still gettin' active
Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic
I ain't heard nothin' that I can consider classic
But this is for my niggas who been runnin' with me
And everybody in this bitch that's out there gunnin' for me
And I got love for my people that stay one hundred with me
I'ma keep it A1, been that way since day one

[Dem Jointz:]
Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers'll join the fallen
So I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers will join the fallen

Drama make the city happy
All I think about is makin' classics
Classics for the masses
This how you make... classic
C-c-classic

[Dem Jointz:]
This is where I leave you
Carry you
In the city of Compton
This is where I leave you
Carry you
Down the Pacific Coast
This is where I leave you
And I will miss you
