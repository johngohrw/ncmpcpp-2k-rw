Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Caroline
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Well, my heavy throbbers itchin'
Just to lay a solid rhythm down
