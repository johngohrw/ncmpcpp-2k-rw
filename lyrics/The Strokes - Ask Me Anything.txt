Right, wrong, what to do
Someday it will come to you
Hostile Indians, we named a summer camp for you

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I'm in utter dismay
I've got nothing to say

Harmless children, we named our soldiers after you
Don't be a coconut, God is trying to talk to you
We could drag it out but that's for other bands to do

I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
But I will fight to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy

I'd like to watch
I'd like to read
I'd like a part
I'd like the lead

But I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say
I've got nothing to say

I've got nothing to give
Got no reason to live
Oh, I'll kill to survive
I've got nothing to hide
Wish I wasn't so shy
