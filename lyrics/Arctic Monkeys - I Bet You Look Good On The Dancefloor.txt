[Verse]
Stop making the eyes at me,
I'll stop making my eyes at you.
What it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to

And your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand and lighting
The fuse might result in a bang b-b-bang-go

[Chorus:]
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or...
Don't know what you're looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984!

[Verse]
I wish you'd stop ignoring me because it's sending me to despair,
Without a sound yeah you're calling me and I don't think it's very fair

That your shoulders are frozen (as cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand and lighting
The fuse might result in a bang with a bang-go

[Chorus]

Oh, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Are just banging tunes and DJ sets and...
Dirty dance floors, and dreams of naughtiness!

Well,

[Chorus]
