Yeah, c'mon 

When the music's over 
When the music's over, yeah 
When the music's over 
Turn out the lights 
Turn out the lights 
Turn out the lights, yeah 

When the music's over 
When the music's over 
When the music's over 
Turn out the lights 
Turn out the lights 
Turn out the lights 

For the music is your special friend 
Dance on fire as it intends 
Music is your only friend 
Until the end 
Until the end 
Until the end 

Cancel my subscription to the Resurrection 
Send my credentials to the House of Detention 
I got some friends inside 

The face in the mirror won't stop 
The girl in the window won't drop 
A feast of friends 
"Alive!" she cried 
Waitin' for me 
Outside! 

Before I sink 
Into the big sleep 
I want to hear 
I want to hear 
The scream of the butterfly 

Come back, baby 
Back into my arm 
We're gettin' tired of hangin' around 
Waitin' around with our heads to the ground 

I hear a very gentle sound 
Very near yet very far 
Very soft, yeah, very clear 
Come today, come today 

What have they done to the earth? 
What have they done to our fair sister? 
Ravaged and plundered and ripped her and bit her 
Stuck her with knives in the side of the dawn 
And tied her with fences and dragged her down 

I hear a very gentle sound 
With your ear down to the ground 
We want the world and we want it... 
We want the world and we want it... 
Now 
Now? 
Now! 

Persian night, babe 
See the light, babe 
Save us! 
Jesus! 
Save us! 

So when the music's over 
When the music's over, yeah 
When the music's over 
Turn out the lights 
Turn out the lights 
Turn out the lights 

Well the music is your special friend 
Dance on fire as it intends 
Music is your only friend 
Until the end 
Until the end 
Until the end!
