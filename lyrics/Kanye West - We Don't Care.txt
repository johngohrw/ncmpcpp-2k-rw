[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
And all my people thats drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say

[Verse One:]
If this is your first time hearing this 
You are about to experience something cold man
We never had nothing handed took nothing for granted
Took nothing from no man, man i'm my own man
But as a shorty i looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man i knew that wasnt a broke man
Flickin starter coats man, Man you ount no man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
Cuz this summer they aint finna to say next summer im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do something man your ass is grown

[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high

Kids Sing Kids Sing

[Kanye and Kids:]
We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say

[Verse Two:]
The second verse is for my dogs working 9 to 5
That still hustle cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling make-up, Jacobs
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work than push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Momma say she wanna move south 
Scratchin lottery tickets Eyes on a new house
Around the same time Doe ran up in dudes house 
Couldnt get a job
So since he couldnt get work he figured hed take work
The drug game bolemic its hard to get weight
So niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
So we gon keep baking to the day we get cake.
And we dont care what people say 
My Niggas 

[Chorus]
[Kanye West and Kids:]
Drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high

Kids Sing Kids Sing

We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say

[Verse Three:]
You know the kids gonna act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS them some of them dislecsic
They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions
We scream, rock, blows, weed park 
so now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make mo'cash
Now tell my momma i belong in the slow class 
It's bad enough we on welfare
You trying to put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair
Im trying to get the car with the chromy wheels here
You tryin to cut our lights like we dont live here
Look at whats handed us our fatheres abandoned us
When we get the hammers gone and call the ambulance
Sometimes i feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say
My Niggas

[Chorus]
[Kanye West and Kids:]
drug dealin jus to get by stack ya money till it gets sky high

Kids Sing Kids Sing

We wasnt supposed to make it past 25 but the jokes on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say we don't care what people say
