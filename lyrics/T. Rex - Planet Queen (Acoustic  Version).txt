Planet Queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head
Like an exploder
The Planet Queen

The worlds the same
I am to blame
She used my head
Like a revolver
The world's the same

Well it's all right
Love is what you want
Flying saucer take me away
Give me your daughter

Dragon head
Machine of lead
Cadillac King
Dancer in the midnight
Dragon head

Planet Queen
Perchance to dream
She used my head
Like a revolver
The world's the same
