Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend," but he was too late
Oh why, oh why
I don't know

So you think things move pretty fast down here
Well just wait my dear 'till you look up there
Oh maybe someday you'll know

Had his second kid, was an early night
Got to be well dressed 'cause he hates to fly
Oh loves his job, takes it home

Anything they wanted
They could have it, have it
Didn't even notice
I don't mind it, mind it

Won't decide, but he won't debate
Said, "Thanks my friend, thought that we was dead"
Oh why, oh why
I don't know

Think things move pretty fast down here
But just wait my dear 'till we get up there
Oh maybe someday they'll know

Come on tell me does she warm the room
When he comes
Or does he just know how to leave
When it gets cold

Well I don't care, I don't care
'Cause it's free
