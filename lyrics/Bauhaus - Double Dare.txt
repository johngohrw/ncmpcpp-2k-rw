I dare you to be real
To touch
To touch a flickering flame
The pangs
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower
Don't cower in night fright

Don't back away just yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal
 
I dare you to despise 
Bureaucracy and all its lies
And avoid
And avoid their stare
They never
They never dare to dare

I dare 
I dare 
I dare you you
