How do you see it? 
The dreams gone
Faded fires, moving on
Why do you need it? 
The waves come
Over you, to undertow

Honestly I can’t believe it’s burning again
Like the first fire
Run from the fences, you don’t have to pretend
In the first fire

And if you can find it, don’t let go 
Hold it tight, keep it close
Don’t even fight it, the leaves fall
Over me, for every blow

Honestly, I can’t believe it’s burning again
Like the first fires
Run from fences, you don’t have to pretend
First fires

And all the memories are calling my name
For the first fire
Honestly, I can’t believe it’s burning again
Like the first fires

Like the first fires 

Honestly, I can’t believe it’s burning again
Honestly, I can’t believe it’s burning again
Like the first fires
