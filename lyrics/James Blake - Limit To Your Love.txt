There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

There's a limit to you care
So carelessly there, is it truth or dare
There's a limit to your care
There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

There's a limit to you care
So carelessly there, is it truth or dare
There's a limit to your care
