Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream

Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream

I make the air fall apart

Around me
Now as the petals are no more
A corroding, shrinking stalk remains 
Bereft of his blooms 
And the ultimate cruelty of love's pinions 
Beset his appearance
Beset his appearance
No king could replenish his state 
Now browning, sinking, dying 
A thousand deaths
A thousand deaths
A thousand deaths

[noise, coughing]

Terry sat up
And hugged the green army surplus bag 
Around his skinny waist 
It was cold 
And the person beside him had faded badly 
Legs apart his eyes lit up 
The sky's gone out
The sky, the sky
The sky's gone out

[noise, snoring]

Ooooooh
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
The sky's gone out
