I'm waiting on words
I'm waiting on the one I've been thinking of
And hoping you heard
I'm waiting on the words

Oh, goodbye
I heard you were leaving
Won't try changing your mind
Goodbye, Don't know where you're going
The only thing I really know
My love for you is real, I

I leave it behind
No longer will I want for a single thing
Stay true in my mind
You have to let 'em in

Oh, goodbye
I heard you were leaving
Won't try changing your mind
Goodbye, don't know where you're going
The only thing I really know
My love for you is real, I
