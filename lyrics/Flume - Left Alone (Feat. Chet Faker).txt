This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves

Good down, I’m for long
Got my word to be someone
Good down, that’s alright
All I want is to be left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, 

Cannot swallow blue found vow
More than that my sleep is wild
All I need is suffering bones
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
Will I freak can I calm down
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
Will I freak can I calm down
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe out sorrow

Gonna find them peace in loss
Holding by the knees and vow
I can always feel this proud
Breathe out sorrow
Oh I tell you something more
What my brain is bleeding for
And it hurts my darling, but breathe out sorrow
Gonna find them peace in loss
Holding by the knees and vow
I can't always feel this proud
Breathe out sorrow
Oh, I tell you something more
What my brain is bleeding for
And it hurts my darling, but breathe out sorrow
