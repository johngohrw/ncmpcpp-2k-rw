Broken mornings, broken nights and broken days in between
Open ground, the sky is open, makes an open sea

Just like in fiction, in every addiction
Oh fantasy's taking over, awake me

I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way

Broken me and broken them
You are broken too
Open ears, their eyes are open
Makes me call for you

But there's no seduction only destruction
Oh fantasy take me over and break me

[x2]
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way

I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live
I feel ali-li-live

[x2]
I've been looking for the conqueror
But you don't seem to come my way
I've been looking for the only one
But you don't seem to come my way
