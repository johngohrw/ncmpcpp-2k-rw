If you're so prone
To accidents and misunderstandings
You may accidentally
Misinterpret honesty for selfishness

We're two human beings
Individually
With inherent interest in
Each other and how we relate

If you're still prone
To accidents and misunderstandings
You won't understand me
Or my motivation for being alone

We're just two human beings
Individually
With inherent interest in
Each other and how we relate

Considering everything
Me leaving with regrets
Only makes sense
I'll see you when we're both not so emotional
