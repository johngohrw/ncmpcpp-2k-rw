I want to write something beautiful,
Something so beautiful
That I just can't sing it
without getting that incredible feeling,
The one that just overwhelms my senses.
Because it's the only thing I have,
It's the only thing that makes my life worthwhile.

I know there aren't too many people
Who allow themselves to say what they feel,
So I was watching your eyes,
In case they just might say something.

I want to think someone's beautiful,
That they're so beautiful it's a thrill to be near them.
Fill my stomach with butterflies,
have me floating on air,
Bring something out of me I didn't know was there.
But it's such a torturous thing
That I am not excited by anyone.

I know there aren't too many people
Who allow themselves to say what they feel,
So I was watching your eyes,
In case they just might say something.
