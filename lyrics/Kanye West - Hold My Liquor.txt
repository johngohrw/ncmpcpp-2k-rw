[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
This man can't handle me
But this man can't handle his weed
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on in Indiana
I'm heard on the radio now

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse: Kanye West]
Bitch I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over, ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya, one more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October, pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over, Yeezy's all on you sofa, these the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover, even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch you don't even know us
Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor, after that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over and bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Bridge + Hook]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Outro: Justin Vernon and Kanye West]
I heard you need a new fad
I heard you need a new stack
I heard you need a new phone
I know your 'rents ain't be home
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh on the phone
