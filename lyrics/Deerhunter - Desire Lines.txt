When you were young
And your excitement showed
But as time goes by is it outgrown?

Is that the way things go?
Forever reaching for the gold?
Forever fading black and comes up cold

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

When you were young
You never knew which way you'd go
What was once grace now undertows

Well, every day do what you can
And if you let them turn you 'round
Whatever goes up must come down

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh

Walking free, wooh
Come with me, wooh
Far away, wooh
Every day, wooh
