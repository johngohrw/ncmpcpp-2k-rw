I guess U know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem 2 get a kick out of doing U cold
Oh, what the hell, U always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on 2?
Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self respect U ever had
I took U 4 a ride and baby I'm sorry
The more U love me sugar, the more it makes me mad

Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then U could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way U where, so I had 2 make U mine

Baby I just can't stand 2 see U happy
More than that I hate 2 see U sad
Honey if U left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (ship, ship, ship)

Mmmmm, my strange relationship
Can't live with U, can't live without U
That's all about..
Do U know? (strange relationship)
I think U and I got a (strange relationship)
What's this strange relationship?
Yeah, yeah [repeated to fade]
