Peeping round the door I got a big surprise
Couldn't see a thing but open skies
They've taken her away where is she now

Wish that she was here wish she'd hold my hand
Maybe she could laugh maybe understand
Why was I so cruel where is she now

Acting like a fool I had to make her cry
Maybe I'm a Leo but I ain't a lion
I'm hurting oh so bad, I want her now
