Look up here, I’m in heaven
I’ve got scars that can’t be seen
I’ve got drama, can’t be stolen
Everybody knows me now
 
Look up here, man, I’m in danger
I’ve got nothing left to lose
I’m so high it makes my brain whirl
Dropped my cell phone down below
 
Ain’t that just like me
 
By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
Then I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass
 
This way or no way
You know, I’ll be free
Just like that bluebird
Now ain’t that just like me
 
Oh I’ll be free
Just like that bluebird
Oh I’ll be free
Ain’t that just like me
