Memories, my memories
How long can you stay
To haunt my days
She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado about nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

All Dead All Dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All Dead All Dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All Dead
And Gone
All Dead...

All Dead All Dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All Dead All Dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All Dead
And gone
All Dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me

I am old but still a child

All Dead All Dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All Dead All Dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead
And gone
All Dead
And gone
