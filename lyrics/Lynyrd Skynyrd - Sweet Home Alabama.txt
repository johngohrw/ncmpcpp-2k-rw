Big wheels keep on turning 
Carry me home to see my kin 
Singing songs about the Southland 
I miss Alabamy once again 
And I think its a sin, yes

Well I heard mister Young sing about her 
Well, I heard ole Neil put her down 
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember 
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow

Sweet home Alabama 
Where the skies are so blue 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lord, I'm coming home to you

In Birmingham they love the gov' nor (boo, boo, boo)
Now we all did what we could do 
Now Watergate does not bother me 
Does your conscience bother you? 
Tell the truth

Sweet home Alabama 
Where the skies are so blue 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lord, I'm coming home to you 
Here I come Alabama

Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers 
And they've been known to pick a song or two 
Lord they get me off so much 
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue 
Now how about you?

Sweet home Alabama 
Where the skies are so blue 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lord, I'm coming home to you

Sweet home Alabama 
Oh sweet home baby 
Where the skies are so blue 
And the guv'nor's true 
Sweet Home Alabama 
Lordy 
Lord, I'm coming home to you 
Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer
