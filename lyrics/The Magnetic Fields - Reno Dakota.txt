Reno DakotaThe Magnetic FieldsReno, DakotaThere's not an iotaOf kindness in youYou know you enthrall meAnd yet you don't call meIt's making me bluePantone 292Reno, DakotaI'm reaching my quotaOf tears for the yearAlas and alackYou just don't call me backYou have just disappearedIt makes me drink beerI know you're a recluseYou know that's no excuseReno, that's just a ruseDo not play fast and loose With my heartReno, DakotaI'm no Nino RotaI don't know the scoreHave I annoyed you Or is there a boy whoWell, he's just a whoreI've had him beforeIt makes me drink more[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Reno_Dakota ]
