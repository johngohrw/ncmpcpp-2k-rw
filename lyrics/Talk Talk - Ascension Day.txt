Bet I'll be damned
Built the debt, I turned twos up today
Bet I'll be damned
Gets harder to sense, to sail

Farewell, mother numb to and devout to
Reckon luck sees us the same

Weighted my hand
Kill the bet, I'll burn on judgment day
Weighted my hand
Get hard hit to sin, to sail

Farewell, mother numb to and devout to
Double deal a season wrapt too lax to lapse so soon
Reckon luck sees us the same

Bed on my back
Dealt my hell, I've dealt my months of May
Bed on my back
Get parted ascension day

Farewell, mother numb to and devout to
Reckon luck sees us the same
Reckon love deals us the same
