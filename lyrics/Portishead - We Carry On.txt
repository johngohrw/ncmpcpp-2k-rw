The taste of life
I can't describe
It's chocking on my mind
Reaching out I can't believe
Faith it can't decide

On and on I carry on
But underneath my mind
And on and on I tell my self
It's this I can't disguise

Oh can't you see
Holding on to my heart
I bleed the taste of life

The pace, the time,
I can't survive
It's grinding down the view
Breaking out which way to choose
A choice I can't renew

Holding on I carry on
But underneath my mind
And on and on I tell my self
It's this I can't disguise

Oh can't you see
Holding on to my heart
I bleed, no place is safe
Can't you see the taste of life
