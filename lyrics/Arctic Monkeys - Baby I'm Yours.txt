[ALEX:]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours) 
And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky, 
Yours, until the rivers all run dry 
In other words, until I die 

[OISIN:]
Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours) 
And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines, 
Yours, until the poets run out of rhyme 
In other words, until the end of time 

[ALEX:]
I'm gonna stay right here by your side, 
Do my best to keep you satisfied 
Nothin' in the world could drive me away 
'Cause every day, you'll hear me say 

Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours) 
And I'll be yours until two and two is three, 
Yours, until the mountains crumble to the sea 
In other words, until eternity 

Baby, I'm yours 
(Til the stars fall from the sky) 
Baby, I'm yours 
(Til the rivers all run dry) 
Baby, I'm yours 
(Til the sun no longer shines) 
Baby, I'm yours 
(Til the poets run out of rhymes)
