Take good core of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all Good Company

Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep Good Company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day and Sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me Company

Now marriage is an insinuation sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door.

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited Company

I hardly noticed Sall as we
Pated Company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see

I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And Keep Good Company
