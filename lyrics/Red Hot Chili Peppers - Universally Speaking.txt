I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me shewolf style
Rip right thru me

[Pre-Chorus:]
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow

[Chorus:]
Come on baby 'cause there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
Take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
Win in the long run

I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Let's go
