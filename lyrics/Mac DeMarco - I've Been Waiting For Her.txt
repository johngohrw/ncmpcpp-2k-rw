Give up my life for the rhythm
For the beat of a heart
Like hers
Start it over to the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

Listen closely for the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
Could I quit it?
Start it over
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
