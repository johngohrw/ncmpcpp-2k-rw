I saw my baby
She was turning blue
Oh, I knew that soon, her
Young life was through

And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be all right, Tonight [x2]

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks, Tonight

Everyone will be all right, Tonight [x2]

No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks, Tonight, Tonight

I am gonna love her to the end [x2]
I will love her 'til I die
I will see her in the sky...Tonight [x5]
