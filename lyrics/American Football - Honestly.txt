Honestly, I can't remember teen dreams
All my teenage feelings and their meanings
They seem too see-through to be true
All the whos are there but the whys are unclear

Picture this, a long-awaited, sickening kiss
How does it feel to know
Explain how you've re-written history
These things change despite the complicated beginning to all of this

Honestly
