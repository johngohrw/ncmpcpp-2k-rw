You wanted to love, but you didn't know how
That's okay, it's up to you now
It got so bad to where I wouldn't allow
But no more, it's up to you now

Let you go so you could go...
Go to town
It's up to you now
It's up to you now

You smoke cigarettes and you act like a clown if you want
It's up to you now
You do what you like and now you wonder why they're gone
It's up to you now

Let you go so you could go...
Let you go so you could go...
It's up to you now
