[Chorus 1:]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1:]
When did you change?
Wendy you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never...
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus 2:]
Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2:]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus 3:]
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs...

[Outro:]
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
When did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(This shit, wanna chew
Tastes like Juicy Fruit
Words have magnitude
Please get me out of that...)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't...)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
