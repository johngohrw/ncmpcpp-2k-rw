The only way to be quiet is to be quick
A slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can’t get sick
I’ll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
Keep outta sight while my watch just ticks
I’m trying to keep quiet but I can’t move quick
Drowning in air, light, floating up in flight
Then it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
You fall

I forced myself to be quiet just to be quick
Lead a slow death rite like an innocent fight
Left me choked and white in a patch of light
Feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
Burned skin like a string black ashes slight
I know I gotta kick but I can’t get sick
I’ll hold you here tight, keep you overnight
And it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
But now I’m fucked to die in a world of shit
I’m trying to keep quiet but I can’t move quick
Wings matted with death spilled oil slick
Then it gets too bright, and your body’s a brick
And you fall
