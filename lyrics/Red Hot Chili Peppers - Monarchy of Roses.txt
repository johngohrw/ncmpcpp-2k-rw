The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep.
Do you like it rough I ask and are you on to task?
The calicoes of Pettibon where cultures come to clash

[Chorus:]
Several of my best friends wear, the colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up, and Sherri wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

The cross between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears of Ireland, a lovely cross to bare

[Chorus:]
Several of my best friends know, the secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up, and Sherri wants to spin it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight

[Chorus:]
Several of my best friends wear, the colors of the crown
And Mary wants to build it up, and Sherri wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses

Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said
Hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will never taunt you

Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said
Hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will then say I want to
The story knows that I will always haunt you
Hey
