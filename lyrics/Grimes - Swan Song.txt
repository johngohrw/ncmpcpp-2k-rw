Eyes all open now
You go by your own
I don't care

Leave me baby
I went away
Lead the way
You know the way

We don't, oh
We don't, we don't, don't, don't
Let, let it [?] see
Hold on to your heart, yeah

Eyes on, I'm going this way
You know, you know the way
Do you know the way?
We don't know
We don't know the way
We don't know
