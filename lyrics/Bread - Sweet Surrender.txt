Baby I'm through runnin' it's true
I'd be a fool to try to escape you
Maybe I'm beat but oh what a sweet surrender

You keep your rights, I'll take your nights
No one can lose when we turn the lights out
Tastin' defeat, lovin' that sweet surrender

I'm givin' up myself to you but I didn't really lose at all
I gained the only love I've known and it never hurt me to fall

Now that it's done, so glad you won
I know our lives have only begun now
No more retreat, only my sweet surrender

Umm Babe, I may be beat, but oh what a sweet surrender
surrender...
And you, sweet thing in my life
I surrender to you
