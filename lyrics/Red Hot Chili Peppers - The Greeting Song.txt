Drivin' around I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music

Makin' my way I brake another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love

TTY Monitor: You have 05 minutes to log out

My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love

Who, you talking to, talk to me you
Sound of music

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me

Sought and I found a life of makin my bloodsound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound the face of God is in sensoround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love

I love you swim through me
Good feelings come to me
