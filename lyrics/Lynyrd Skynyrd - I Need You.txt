Ain't no need to worry 
Ain't no use to cry 
'Cause I'll be comin' home soon 
To keep you satisfied 
You know I get so lonely 
That I feel I can't go on 
And it feels so good inside, baby 
Just to call you on the telephone 
I said...

[Chorus]
Oh baby, I love you 
What more can I say 
Oh baby, I need you 
I miss you more everyday

I woke up early this morning 
And sun came shining down 
And it found me wishin' and hopin' 
Mama, you could be around 
Well ,you know that I need you 
More than the air that I breathe 
And I guess I'm just trying to tell you woman 
Oh, what you mean to me

[Chorus]

I try to tell you I love you 
In each and every way 
I'm trying to tell you I need you 
Much more than a piece of leg

[Chorus]

Oh baby, I love you 
What more can I say 
Oh baby I need your sweet lovin 
I miss you more every day
