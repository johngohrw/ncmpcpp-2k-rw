Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me 

I'm a lot like you so please, hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me 

I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (how cool is that)
How cool is that?
So I went to your room and read your diary:
Watching Grunge leg drop New-Jack through a presstable...
And then my heart stopped:
Listening to Cio-Cio San, fall in love all over again. 

I'm a lot like you so please, hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me 

How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute
Just come up to me
And say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say: 'I'm falling for you' 

I wish I could get my head out of the sand
Cos I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
Cos I can't even look in your eyes without shaking, and I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon 

I'm a lot like you so please, hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me 

I'm a lot like you
I'm a lot like you
I'm a lot like you
And I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me
