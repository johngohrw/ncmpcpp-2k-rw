Ohh........
Can anybody see the light
Where the morn meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise, no one can see inside your view
Did you realise, for why this sight belongs to you

Ohh........
Just set aside your fears of life
Thru this sole desire

Done it warning
Done it now
This ain't real
On in this side

Done it warning
Done it now
This ain't real
On in this side

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Done it warning
Done it now
This ain't real

Done it warning
Done it now
This ain't real
On in this side

Ohh............
Can anybody see the light
Were the morn meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realise, no one can ever see inside you view
Did you realise, forewhy this sight belongs to you
