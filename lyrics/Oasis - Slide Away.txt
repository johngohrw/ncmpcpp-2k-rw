Slide away - and give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now? 

Hold me down - all the world's asleep
I need you now - you've knocked me off my feet
I dream of you - we talk of growing old
But you said please don't ! 

Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - and I know just what you're saying to me 

Now that you're mine
I'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning when you don't know what to do
Two of a kind
We'll find a way
To do what we've done 

Let me be the one that shines with you
And we can slide away. 

Slide away - and give it all you've got
My today - fell in from the top
I dream of you - and all the things you say
I wonder where you are now? 

Slide in baby - together we'll fly
I've tried praying - and I know just what you're saying to me 

Now that you're mine
I'll find a way
Of chasing the sun
Let me be the one that shines with you
In the morning when you don't know what to do
Two of a kind We'll find a way
To do what we've done
