Bill Barret has a simple dream
He calls it his plan B
Buildings in the sky and the air is sugar free
And everyone is very friendly
Plan B arrived on a holiday
Took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore
Then found love on channel 44

[Chorus]
LA LA LA LA LA HE WANTS TO GO TO MAGIC AMERICA
LA LA LA LA LA HE'D LIKE TO LIVE IN MAGIC AMERICA
WITH ALL THE MAGIC PEOPLE

Bill Barrett sent his postcards home
To everyone he'd ever known they read
Fifty nine cents gets you a good square meal
From the people who care how you feel

[Chorus x 2]

With all the magic people [fade to end]
