Don't worry this face
Hold my hand in error
Don't tell of this place 
It's for me and you only

Softly, softly know me

Don't worry this face
Hold my hand in error
Don't tell of this place
It's for me and you only

You give me love, pa
You know you give me love, papa
In an ultraviolet way
You know you give me love, pa
You know you give me love, pa, papa

Ultraviolet

You know you give me love, pa
You know you give me love, papa
In an ultraviolet way
You know you give me love, pa
You know you give me love, pa

Ultraviolet

You give me love, pa
You know you give me love, papa
In an ultraviolet way
You know you give me love, pa
You know you give me love, pa, papa

Ultraviolet

You know you give me love, pa
You know you give me love, papa
In an ultraviolet way
You know you give me love, pa
You know you give me love, pa, papa
