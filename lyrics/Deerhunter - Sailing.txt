Wind in my sails
I lived for days
No water, no food
It was good

I didn't mind, no
Nowhere to be
Nothing to see
Except me

Only fear
Can make you feel lonely out here
You learn to accept
Whatever you can get

When there is no law
You've done nothing wrong
You can't take too long
Making up songs

Only fear
Can make you feel lonely out here
You learn to accept
Whatever you can get
Whatever you can get

Only fear
Can make you feel lonely out here
You learn to accept
Whatever you can get
Whatever you can get
