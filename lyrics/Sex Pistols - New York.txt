An immitation from New York
You're made in Japan
From cheese and chalk
You're hipy tarts hero
'cos you put on bad show
Oh don't it show

Still oh out on those pills
Oh do you remember

Think it is well playing Max's kansas
You're looking bored
And you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut
You better keep yer mouth shut
You better keep yer mouth shut
In a rut

Still oh out on those pills
Do the sambo

You four years on
You still look the same
I think about time
You changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor litlle faggot
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me

Think it's well playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor litlle faggot
You're sealed with a kiss

Still oh out on those pills
Cheap thrills anadins
Aspros anything you're condemned
To eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me

A kiss a kiss you're sealed with a kiss
A looking for a kiss you're coming to this
I wanna kiss anything
Oh kiss this gay boy
