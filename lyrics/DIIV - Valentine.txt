The right side of me
Is the right side of me
Burn it down and give it up
You never wanna give it up

Medicine for free
If you’d only asked for me
I’d be a better animal
In every other little way

Stuck inside of me
In tragedy I’m complete
Mother father daughter son
My Valentine my only one

Keep me in distant sight
Of when it's day and when it's night
And how many weeks have passed
And if I'm still who I was last
