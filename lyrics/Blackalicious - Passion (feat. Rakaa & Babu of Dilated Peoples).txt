[Cuts by Chief Xcel and DJ Babu]

An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest MCs out there

[Chorus]
[Rakaa, Gift of Gab]

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

[Rakaa]
Propaganda, positive propositions
Politician, musician and a triple optician
Still part of my missions to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without blacks, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

[Gift of Gab]
Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-ine
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Runnin' through the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga ride, nigga ride..

[Chorus]
[Rakaa, Gift of Gab]

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

[Rakaa]
Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion
The journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find morning
Passion
The ladies they love the long-lasting
Asking for action, braced for satisfaction

[Gift of Gab]
Passion
The black-skinned African jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed

[Rakaa]
I'm still here, I've seen cats get killed here
I've seen cats make a mil but millionaires still fear
You can buy airplanes but you can't buy cheers
Blackalicious, Dilated, vibratin' your ears

[Gift of Gab]
Sent vibrations for years, I've been waiting for years
I've been patient for years, we ain't playin' this year
We hold stake in this here, it ain't safe for this year
We in the zone watch next level, takin' it there, this is

[Chorus]
[Rakaa, Gift of Gab]

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

[Gift of Gab]
Had a rough week, it got beat by passion
Saddled up, tweaked off a beat, started mashin'
Matador Rica, the heat from the heater
In her world, dwellin', hear the world
Yellin' for a leader

[Rakaa]
I don't bother with the dealers, I take it to the lab
It's Rakaa chillin' with Babs, Xcel, Gift of Gab
I grab mics and fans gravitate, I can't waste it
My whole life, I wanted it so bad, I could taste it
