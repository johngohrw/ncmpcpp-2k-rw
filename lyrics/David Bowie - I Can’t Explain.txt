New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down in my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explain
