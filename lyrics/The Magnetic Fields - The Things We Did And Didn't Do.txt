The Things We Did And Didn't DoThe Magnetic FieldsAll the things I knew I didn't know and didn't want to knowThat you told me just to tell me later that you'd told me soCome flooding back to me nowCome onCome flooding back to me nowAll the things you said you'd never say and you said anywayThe things we did and didn't do the things we did and didn't doCome flooding back to me now[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:The_Things_We_Did_And_Didn%27t_Do ]
