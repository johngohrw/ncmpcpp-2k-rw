Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point is that there ain't no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there

You know, oh, it's a funny thing, you know?
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all OK to carry on that way

'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Don't you know, oh it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
'Cause their minds are made up
And course is all OK to carry on that way
But I said no, oh no!
Well oh, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go, oh no, no?

But over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, I've known them for a long long time
And yet they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
No not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no!
