As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you

Treasure these few words till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

I'll be coming home again to you, love
And till the day I do, love
P.S. I love you
You, you, you

You, you, you

And till the day I do, love
