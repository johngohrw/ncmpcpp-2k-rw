Now I yearn to follow you in everything I do
All those years in isolation helped me want for you
Lead me to a place I'm free from all the wrongs I do
In, in, in, in return I'll live forever loving you

Closer, I'm here to be closer
Closer to you, to you, to you, to you
Closer, I'm ready now closer
Closer to you, to you, to you, to you... Oh!

In my mind, eternal darkness
Seemed like it was true (True, true, true)
Oh so wretched, wretched, wretched, wretched
My savior knew I was weary (I was lost)
I was sleepy but you held me through
Carried me along the sand your footsteps gold and good

Closer, I'm here to be closer
Closer to you, to you, to you, to you... Oh!
Closer, I'm ready now closer
Closer to you, to you, to you, to you... Oh!

All those years in isolation
Isolation...
Isolation...
