He told me
Wait here patiently but
I wonder if he's kidding
Well maybe he could be serious now
Maybe not
Maybe not
Because'

Love is crazy
Pretty baby
Take it real slow
My feelings show
All you have to do
Is never ever let go
My feelings show
And I want you to know
My feelings show

I'm sorry it's taking me so long
To find out what I'm feeling
I wonder if it will come to me
Maybe not
Maybe not
Because'

Love is crazy
Pretty baby
Take it real slow
My feelings show
All you have to do
Is never ever let go
My feelings show
And I want you to know
My feelings show

How I want you to know

What I'm trying to say is that
I'm feeling a change and
I'll let it take all over
If you need time away
I won't ask you to stay
But I don't want to lose you

Love is crazy
Pretty baby
Take it real slow
My feelings show
All you have to do
Is never ever let go
My feelings show
Love is crazy
Pretty baby
Take it real slow
My feelings show
All you have to do
Is never ever let go
My feelings show
And I want you to know
My feelings show

Never ever let go
My feelings show
Never ever let go
My feelings show
Never ever let go
My feelings show
