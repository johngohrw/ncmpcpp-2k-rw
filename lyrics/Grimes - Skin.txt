Soft skin
You touch me within and so I know I could be human once again
I know you're faced with something
That could consume you completely

Soft skin
You touch me once again and somehow it stings
â€˜Cos I know it is the end
I hate that you're leaving
So why don't you talk to me?
You act like nothing ever happened
But it meant the world to me

And you can't and you can't see the wind in the trees
And you can't and you can't see the wind in the leaves
And you can't and you can't see the weight in the dark
And you can't and you can't see the weight in the heart

Soft skin
I'll have you be near my heart,
Until I feel human
Soft skin
You were never a lie to begin with
So now I'm suffering
