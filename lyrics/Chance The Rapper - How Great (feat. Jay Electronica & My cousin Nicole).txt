[Intro - My Cousin Nicole:]
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great, is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, is our God

[Intro skit:]
The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
Till one score in three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrified the enemy like Hedwig till he petrefied
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's is behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like "shhh"

[Verse 2 - Jay Electronica:]
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, I rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height, wage won
The poltergeist to exalt the Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
'O son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
Poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground
