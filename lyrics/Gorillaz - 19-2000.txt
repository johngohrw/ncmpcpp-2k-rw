The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose

My mama said to slow down
You must make my own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Keep a my groove on

Ba ba ba
Bay do de bop

Here you go!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!

(There's a-)

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapour trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between it's brain and his tail

And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

Keep a my groove on

Ba ba ba
Bay do de bop

OK bring it down yeah we gonna break out
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!
Get the cool!
Get the cool shoeshine!

Ah Ah Ah Ah

Day doo de bop
