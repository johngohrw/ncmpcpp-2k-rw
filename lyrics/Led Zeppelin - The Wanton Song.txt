Silent woman in the night, you came, Took my seed from my shaking frame. 
Same old fire, another flame, And the wheel rolls on. 

Silent woman through the flames, you come, From the deep behind the sun 
Seems my nightmares, have just begun 
Left me barely holding on. 

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand. 
When we know the time has come 
Lose my senses, lose command 
Feel your healing rivers run 

Is it every time I fall, That I think this is the one 
In the darkness can you hear me call 
Another day has just begun. 

Silent woman, my face is changed 
Some know in ways to come. 
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame 
And the wheels rolls on.... rolls on.
