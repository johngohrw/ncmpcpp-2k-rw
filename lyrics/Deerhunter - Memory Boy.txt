Did you stick with me?
Let me jog my memory
I see you leaving
Oh, don't forget your TV

It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore

That October
he came over every day
The smell of loose-leaf
joints on jeans and we would play

"It's not a house anymore."
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore
It's not a house anymore

Try to recognize your son
In your eyes he's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Is there anyone who
Wants to see the sun go down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
