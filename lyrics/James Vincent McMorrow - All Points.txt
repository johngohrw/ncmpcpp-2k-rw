In the canyon I was started young. 
In the ocean, in the valley run. 
There was hope that time would disappear, 
in the smoke and when the valley clears.

And I think about the cold air. 
I've been thinking about cold air.

And I was (I was) in the dark. 
I was (I was) in the dark, I was. [x2]

In imaginary destiny, 
reached the palms and stretched around the skin. 
Every breath that echoes endlessly, 
every point to ever let it leave.

Still I'm thinking of the cold air, 
always thinking of the cold air.

And I was (I was) in the dark. 
I was (I was) in the dark, I was. [x2]

Tripping the call, distance is you. 
Lifting it out, we kept it with odds. 
Thinking the motion that been hurt. 
Setting in a fire I can't stand the dark. 
Spilling in to fallness of it all.

And I've been thinking bout the cold air, 
always thinking of the cold air.

And I was in the dark. 
I was in the dark, I was. [x2]
