There's a man on the corner
Got his head in his hat
He dances like a gypsy
So he must be where it's at.
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out ev'rybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock.
The wind is the thing
That makes the body swing
It brings you up and takes you down
And treats you like a king
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out ev'rybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock.

Met a little Momma
She was sweet,
She was gone
She's got legs like a railroad
Face like a song
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out
Ev'rybody shout do the rock,
Do the woodland rock.

Wind is in the willows
My house is up a tree
The seas of change are flowing
I want everybody free
To do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out ev'rybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock.
Met a little Momma
She was sweet, she was gone
She's got legs like a railroad
Face like a song
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out ev'rybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock.
Ally bally bash bam rock-a billy boom
Do the rock, do the woodland rock
Let it all hang out ev'rybody shout
Do the rock, do the woodland rock.
