Sometimes I feel
That I need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Can't forget you
Can't forget you
