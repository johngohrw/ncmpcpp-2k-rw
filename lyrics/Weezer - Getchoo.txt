This is beginning to hurt
This is beginning to be serious
It used to be a game
Now it's a crying shame
Cos you don't wanna play around no more 

Sometimes I push too hard
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee
I never meant to do
All that I've done to you
Please baby say it's not too late 

Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo, uh-huh 

You know this is breaking me up
You think that I'm some kind of freak, uh-huh
But if you'd come back to me
Then you would surely see
That I'm just fooling around 

Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo, uh-huh 

I can't believe (I can't believe)
What you've done to me
What I did do them (What I did do them)
You've done to me 

Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo, uh-huh 

This is beginning to hurt
This is beginning to hurt
This is beginning to hurt
This is beginning to hurt
