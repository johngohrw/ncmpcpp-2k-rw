Monday morning feels so bad
Everybody seems to nag me
Coming Tuesday I feel better
Even my old man looks good
Wednesday just don't go
Thursday goes too slow
I've got Friday on my mind

[CHORUS]
(See my baby)
Gonna have fun in the city 
(feel like fucking you)
(Do my baby screw)
Be with my girl 
she's so pretty
(all I want to do)
(I'll go crazy)
She looks fine tonight
(zoom zoom zoom) 
She is out of sight to me (so divine)
(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)

There is nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar 
man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind

[CHORUS]

(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl [repeat ad lib.]
