[Person 1:] In this very room,
we spent the day and looked over antiquities.
Don't you remember?

[Person 2:] Do I know you?
I can't recall this face, but I want to.

[Person 1:] In this very room, we flew across the sea,
in the ship Saturnia.
Don't you remember?

[Person 2:] I can't remember your face,
but I hope the ship will carry us there,
in the ship Saturnia.
