You used to have all the answers
And you, you still have them too
And we, we live half in the daytime
And we, we live half at night

Watch things on vcrs
With me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars
You say you think we are the best thing
But you, you just know
You just do

I wanna find myself by the sea
In anothers company
By the sea
I wanna go out to the pier
I'm gonna dive and have no fear
Cos you, you just know
You just do

Watch things on vcrs
With me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars
You say you think we are the best thing
But you, you just know
You just do
