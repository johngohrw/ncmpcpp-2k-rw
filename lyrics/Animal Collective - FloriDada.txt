Child 
of limousines 
What’s the best place 
That you have seen
all of the hands 
That you have shook
Home of the queen of everything fancy
Is there a smell
That you can tell
gives you some peace
sends you to hell
all of the beds
That you have yearned
Is there a dream to
where you’d return
Where is the plight
With the most stars
Where do you drink
By Echo guitars
What’s the best shore
Seen from a boat
Miniature heads that 
color the shore line
If you could rest 
A minute to tell
Get me some grass
Iridescent shells
I know there’s a nest
Fit with a hatch
Sunset a glowin’
Makes us all sweaty

I don’t even know where to begin 
or how I should start these days. 
The green mountain south or 
The Clay of the westerns

The Maryland meadows at midnight they do have a misty grace
Take a trip to blue bayou 
Find Roy Orbison cryin’

A continent molded from glass 
or maybe a town I can taste. Dresses that glow on 
girls from Barcelona

I wanna discover the key 
And open the everywhere place 
A mix of sky from Montana 
dipped in FloriDada

FloriDada

Old 
demented men
Where is the place
We can extend
Crooked state lines
Polka dot signs
Say that this place is
a state of mind
Pretty lip girls
Paint me the halls
Not on a street
Not near a mall
Raise me a thumb
From human skin
That isn’t judged by
where it begins
Show me the clams
Show me the pearls
Mail me a note
Sent from a world
That isn’t so far
And always right here
Where all the boundaries
Have disappeared
And all the nights
Are stitched with a glue
That’s sticking to me
And I’ll stick to you
I’ll take your hands
You’ll take my face
And everywhere home will
be a good place

I found myself there a collagin’
With all of the human race
A dancer from Ghana 
smiling in Tijuana
I Frankenstein java with touches of Prada 
and corn on the plates
A smear of gardenia 
in the fair hair of sweden
And maybe I actually visited 
some sort of mythical place
Or was it a future
connected by sutures
Oh let’s go get lost in the image 
I made of the everywhere place
I see the lads from Osaka 
dyed in FloriDada

FloriDada

Where’s the bridge that’s gonna take me home
the bridge that someone’s fighting over
a bridge that someone’s paying for
a bridge so old just let it go
