There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
There are no boundaries set, the time and yet you waste it still

So it slips through your hands like grains of sand, you watch it go
There's no time to be lost, you'll pay the cost, so get it right
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good

And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening, without seeing

There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took
There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good

And never was there an answer, there an answer
Not without listening, without seeing

There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good
There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in
There was no promise made, the part you've played, the chance you took

(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There are no answers here, when you look out you don't see in)
(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)

(There's no way out of here, when you come in you're in for good)
(There's no way out of here...)
