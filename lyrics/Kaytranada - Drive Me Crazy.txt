[Vic Mensa:]
Yeah, see the street lights?
I ain't slept in like 48
I'm back!

I'm here and y'all know they've been waitin' for me
Since I was 15, now I'm Yella, a hundred miles and runnin'
Easy come and easy go, that's why I work 'til midnight
I'm out of town, shorty very, dirty on the turnpike
My piss clean, I caught a case of happens to the best
The lawyer said don't smoke
I'm like, "Good lord, buddha keep me blessed"
I'm buyin' Nike stock when I see these checks
Motivated by niggas because it's bigger than me
I know that, I might go back to my old shit
Bring the fro back, that's a throwback, yeah
Watch your mouth, why you tryna talk like you know somethin'?
My competition is myself, therefore I ain't worried 'bout no one
Not a soul, pot of gold
Lookin' like a stain, niggas'll wet your mud
Leave you behind yourself, you're playin' catch up
Boy is that your blood?
Cause I done blew inside my mind since I first wrote a rhyme
Y'all all late, rappers be stuck in the booth, I'm All State
They're imposters, steak and lobster
Surf my turf, better wear your chopper
Next to Oprah at the opera, okay
If you had...

If you had everything you'd ever wanted
Right in front of me, what's it gonna be?
The lights and the drugs and the girls finally drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy

Gotta love it though, they're hatin', homie
I be on Sunsets then go back to 68th and Stony
Cooked out my basement
Dropped my tape and got my homies' placements
I'll play the keys in my sleep on the beach, that's a dream vacation
Say you ain't heard, I'll let you lie, just know you digged your grave
No turnin' back once you done found that that's the hand you played
Game over, on the drivin' range in the Range Rover
Halfway sober with my middle finger up, fuck these hoes
I'm a tiger in the jungle
In the middle of the summer with the wood on me and a fiend for the snow
(White girl?) She a fiend for the blow, I'm a G, to the code
You know me, I need Keke Palmer off TLC for that T.O.P
Keys to the Jeep and the deed to the boat
Y'all cruisin', y'all losin'
Yeah I make pop music but I'm still king with the flow
This what you should've been thinkin' about

Picture everything you ever want, want, want, want
Right in front of you
The lights and the drugs and the girls finally drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy

Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
