Werewolves Werewolves
Skies will brighten
Werewolves Werewolves
Skies will brighten
Brighten brighten brighten

My werewolf my weight of the day
And I know and I howl and I pray
My werewolf my weight of the day
And I walk and I whine and I pray

I was blinded
The skies will brighten
And I run away

I was blinded
The skies run away

I was blinded
The skies will brighten
And I run away

My baby I can’t run away

I was blinded
The skies will brighten
And I run away

I was blinded
The skies run away

I was blinded
The skies will brighten
And I run away

All because I can’t watch the day

I will run away I
Werewolf
I will run away I
Werewolf

I was so afraid
And I howl and I pay and I pray
I was so afraid
And I howl and I pay and I pray

I was blinded
The skies will brighten
And I run away
Hold me cause I can’t watch the day
