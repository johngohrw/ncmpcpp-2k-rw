She was walking, all alone
Down the street, in the alley
Her name was Sally, I never touched her
She never saw it
When she was hit by, space junk
She was smashed by, space junk
She was killed by, space junk

In New York, Miami Beach
Heavy metal fell, in Cuba
Angola, Saudi Arabia
On Christmas Eve, said NORAD
A Soviet sputnik, hit Africa
India, in Venezuela
In Texas, Kansas 
It's falling fast, Peru too
It keeps coming, it keeps coming, it keeps coming

And now I'm mad about, space junk
I'm all burned out about, space junk
Oooh walk and talk about, space junk 
It smashed my baby's head, space junk
And now my Sally's dead, space junk
