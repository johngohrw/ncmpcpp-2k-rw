Early late at night
I wander off into a land
You can go, but you mustn't tell a soul
There's a world inside

Where dreamers meet each other
Once you go it's hard to come back
Let me paint your canvas as you dance

Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
I think I'm in love, angel

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
I think me left me underpants

The grass grows inside
The music floats you gently on your toes
Touch the nose, he'll change our clothes to tuxedos
Don't freak and hide
I'll be your secret santa, do you mind?
Don't resist
The fairygods will have a fit
We should dance

Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind
Makes love to mine
I think I'm in love, angel

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
I think me left me underpants

This is your land
This is my land
We belong here
Stay the night
I am so inspired
You touched my wires
My supernova shining bright

Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take me back to Wondaland
I think me left me underpants
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
