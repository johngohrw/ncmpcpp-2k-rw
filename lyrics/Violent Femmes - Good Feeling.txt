Good feeling, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving when I need you here just a little longer
Dear lady, there's so many things that I have come to fear
Little voice says I'm going crazy to see all my worlds disappear
Vague sketch of a fantasy laughing at the sunrise like he's been up all night
Ooh, slipping and sliding, what a good time but now, I have to find a bed that can take this weight

Good feeling, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving when I know the other one just a little too well
Oh, dear lady, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
You know it always seems like you're leaving when I need you here just a little longer
