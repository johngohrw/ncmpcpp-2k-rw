You look so good to me
Here in this old saloon
Way back in West Berlin
A bottle of white wine
White wine and you
A table made of wood
And how I wish you would
Fall in love with me
You look so good to me
Standing out in the street
With your cheap fur on
Or maybe your plastic raincoat
And your plastic shoes
They look good too
Standing in the snow
You're younger than you look
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
How I wish you would
A table made of wood
And a, a bottle of white wine
And you, and a bottle of white wine and you
And when you're standing
In the street and it's cold
And it snows on you
And you look younger than you really are

I wish you would
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
Fall in love with me
I wish you would
Fall in love with me yeah, yeah

The way your eyes are black
The way your hair is black
The way your heart is young
There's just a few like you
Just the kind I need
To fall in love with me
Oh and you look so good
Oh yes you look so good

A bottle of white wine
A cigarette and you
Here in this saloon
White wine and you
I wish you'd fall in love with me
I wish you'd fall in love with me
'Cause there's just a few like you
So young and real
There's just a few like you
So young and real
Fall in love with me [x4]
I wish you would
You look so good
Oh when you're young at heart
There's just a few like you
You're young at heart
Won't you
Come to this old saloon
Come to my waiting arms
A table made of wood
And I will look at you
'Cause you're so young and pure
And you're young at heart
You're young at heart
A bottle of white wine

And when you're tumbling down
You just look better
When you're tumbling down
You just look finer
