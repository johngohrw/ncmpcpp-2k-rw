Well, Billy Joe told me ,well everything's lookin' fine 
He got the place all secure, got the icebox full of wine 
He said, now hurry on all and don't be late 
I got three lovely ladies who just won't wait 
We'll do some down south jukin', lookin' for some peace of mind

Now put your Sunday pants, lets get out on the road 
We've been workin' all week and I think its time we let go 
We got three fine mamas sitting all alone 
Gonna sip our wine, gonna get it on 
And do some down south jukin, lookin' for some peace of mind

Well, come Monday morning we'll be headed out to the the field 
We'll be doin' everything for Papa and ol' Uncle Bill 
Well, come Friday night we'll be headed to town 
Tryin' to pick up any woman hanging around 
And do some down south jukin', lookin' for some peace of mind 
And do some down south jukin', lookin' for some peace of mind 
And do some down south jukin', lookin' for a peace of mind
