[Intro: Swae Lee]
Up Like Donald Trump, Word, Up, Up, Now you done fucked up

[Hook x2: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, Up, chain swang like nun chucks huh
She gon’ chew you up, yup, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wild up, up soldiers at a ten-hut
Look what you done uh, now you done fucked up

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Read my lips I do my own stunts
Bitch wanna go on a date
Pull up to SunTrust
Wear my hat to the front, yea, like I drive a truck
Like I drive a truck, all white Bentley truck
ATM go nuts, I do what I want, bitch
I say what I want, I grew up on pot
Kush smell just like must, turn it into dust
Man my style is tough, y'all hoe throw that puss
Twerk like she from Russia, try hard not to love her
But she so damn bad, I might have to cuff her
Rock like Billy Ray, that’s a nigga idol
Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes list, Forbes
Read it like the bible

[Hook x2: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, Up  ,chain swang like nun chucks huh
She gon’ chew you up, yup, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wild up, up soldiers at a-ten-hut
Look what you done uh, now you done fucked up

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Up like Trump, all of a sudden
Solo cup one boy to the purple
Bailmain’s clean as a whistle
Green ain't the issue; little bit of money make a difference
Nothing or something, it’s so hard to function with all of these hoes in the house
Fuck your assumption, my blood still rushin’, my heart still thumpin’
Up like Trump, giggin’ like Ike
Got a bitch twerkin' on skype
MGM every night, Sremm at the door, king of the swipe
Mother fuckers worry bout likes on their pictures
They ain't gotta equal dollars, or a nickel
They ain’t even gotta penny for the strippers
Yet they wanna pop bottles like winners
Check my pedigree, I always been a money fiend
All these fuckin rings, I'm shining like a fuckin’ king
Breaking down the kush, don't it look so plush
Take a couple puffs, up like Donald Trump

[Hook x3: Swae Lee]
Up like Donald Trump, Up, chain swang like nun chucks huh
She gon’ chew you up, yup, twerk like she from Russia
Don't get me wild up, up soldiers at a ten-hut
Look what you done uh, now you done fucked up

Up like Trump.
