Laocoön and her two sons
Pressured storm, tried to move
No other more emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

Lighted in a room, in the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing

Laocoön and her two sons
Run the gamut, sated view
Know them more, emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

Lighted in a room, in the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing

In a room, lock the door, latch the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing

Laocoön and her two sons
Ran the gamut, settled new
Find a place fit to laugh
Lock the doors and latch the room

Lighted in a room, in the room
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune

Lighted, lighted, laughing in tunes
Lighted, lighted, laughing in tune
