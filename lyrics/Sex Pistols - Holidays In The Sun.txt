Cheap holiday in other peoples misery

I don't wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to the new Belsen
I wanna see some history
Cause now I got a reasonable economy

Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall

In sensurround sound in a two inch wall
I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine and I got World War three
I'm looking over the wall and they're looking at me

Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall

They're staring all night
And they're staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
And now I got a reason
It's no real reason
And I'm waiting
The Berlin wall

I got to go over the Berlin wall
I don't understand this thing at all
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall

Claustrophobia there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets
So when will we fall
And now I gotta reason
It's no real reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall

I got to go over the wall
I don't understand this thing at all
This third rate B movie show
Cheap dialogue
Cheap essential scenery
I got to go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin wall
Before they come over the Berlin wall
I don't understand this thing at all
I'm gonna go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
Before they come over the Berlin wall
I don't understand this thing at all
Please don't be waiting for me
