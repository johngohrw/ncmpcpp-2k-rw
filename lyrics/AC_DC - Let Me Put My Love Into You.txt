Flying on a free flight
Driving all night with my machinery
Cause I
I got the power any hour
To show the man in me
I got
Reputations blown to pieces with my artillery
Well I'll be guiding and we'll be riding
Giving what you got to me
Don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry cause it's your turn tonight
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

Like a fever burning faster
You spark the fire in me
Crazy feelings got me reeling
They got me raising steam
Now don't you struggle
Don't you fight
Don't you worry cause it's your turn tonight, yeah
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

Let me, let me
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe
Let me cut your cake with my knife

Let me put my love into you babe
Let me put my love on the line
Let me put my love into you babe

Let me give it all
Let me give it all
To you
To you
Give it all
