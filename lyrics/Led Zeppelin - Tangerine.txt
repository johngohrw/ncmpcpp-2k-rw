Measuring a summer's day, I only finds it slips away to grey, 
The hours, they bring me pain. 

[Chorus]
Tangerine, Tangerine, Living reflection from a dream; 
I was her love, she was my queen, And now a thousand years between. 

Thinking how it used to be, Does she still remember times like these? 
To think of us again? And I do. 

[Chorus]
