Do the bad thing,
Take off your wedding ring,
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse,

Oh the night's like a whirlwind,
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me but it's alright,
She's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me,
He's not the jealous type,
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away,
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say,
I've been before,
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore,
Well, she's talking but I'm not entirely sure, oh

Do the bad thing,
Take off your wedding ring,
But it won't make it that much easier, it might make it worse,

Oh I'm stood at the bar and somebody's partner's talking to me,
But I don't know that is what she isn't she murmurs things to confirm That the tragedy is true,
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants,
And I'm struggling to think of an immediate response,

Like I don't mind,
Be a big mistake,
For you to wait,
And let me waste your time,
Really love it's fine,
Really love it's fine,

And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy,

I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy,
Oh but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse,
She said, "It's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse.
