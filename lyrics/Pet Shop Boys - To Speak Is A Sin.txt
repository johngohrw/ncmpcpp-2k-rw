We've been around forever
Look at us now together
Ordering drinks at the bar

Saying hello to menfriends
Smiling across a friend's friends
Ordering drinks at the bar

To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare

(Ta da da da da aah Ta da da da da)

We'll stand around forever
Regardless of time or weather
Ordering drinks at the bar

Looking for love, and getting
Nothing that's worth regretting
But wondering why we travel so far

To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare

To speak is a sin
You'd better beware (aah)
But once in a while
A smile, if you dare (aah)

(Aah, Aah, Aah)

To speak is a sin
You look first, then stare
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare

To speak is a sin
You'd better beware (aah)
And once in a while
A smile, if you dare (oooh)

(Aaah Aaah Oooh)

(Aaah)
