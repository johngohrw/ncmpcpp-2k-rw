So now that she is gone
You won't be sad for long
For maybe just an hour or just a moment
Of the day
Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her
You think you'll have a ball
And you won't care at all
You'll find another girl or maybe more
To pass the time away
Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You just don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her
She's not home when you call
So you can go to all
The places where she used to go
But she has gone away
Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
You don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her, find her, find her
Blue turns to grey (blue turns to grey)
She has gone away (blue turns to grey)
I feel so bad (blue turns to grey)
I wish you'd come on home (blue turns to grey)
I feel, I feel so down...
