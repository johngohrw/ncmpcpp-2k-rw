Have you seen them? 
The words cut open your poor intestines 
Can't deny when the inky periods drip from your mailbox and blood flies dip and glide reach down
Inside
There's something living in these lines.

And when your newest kisser is peeking 
You dress yourself up tonight get all tangled up in arms and legs it's cramped up and someone grabs a hold do you go 
Ohhhhh
Should you go home? 
There's something starting don't know why.

And in a house so cozy few words are spoken 
Let's take our shoes off and unwind when there's minuets off in the background drowning out eyes off ears off test the kiss 
Goodnight
A kiss goodnight
Don't keep my loving on my mind.

Because it's messy, yes, this mess is mine
Though mine is messy yours is maybe nine

Look we've had similar stitches
Look we have similar frowns
Do the elderly couples still kiss and hug and grab their big wrinkly skin so tough wrinkly wrink wrink wrinkly roughâ€¦?

Did you see the words you know?
(Give me rabies bring you babies at the hospital)
Violent ends with friends that go 
(I kissed a few in sticky shoes our cartoon show is broken)  
Doo, doo, doo, doo...
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
