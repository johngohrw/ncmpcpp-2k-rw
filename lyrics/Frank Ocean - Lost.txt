[Verse 1:]
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby (Yo we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weight the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been goin' to work
Boss ain't workin' you like this
He can't take care of you like this

[Hook:]
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost

[Verse 2:]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weight the work I got on your girl (Too weird to live, too weird to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
She's at a stove (Who?)
Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be
Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
No nothin' wrong with a lie
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost
