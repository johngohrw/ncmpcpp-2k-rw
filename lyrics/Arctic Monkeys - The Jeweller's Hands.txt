Fiendish wonder in the carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek

You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless and weightless your imagination runs

And now it's no ones fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

In the moonlight they're more thrilling those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit was like falling off the ferry in the night

The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
It became laughter's assassin shortly after he showed you what it was

And now it's no ones fault but yours, at the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

If you've a lesson to teach me I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece I can't calibrate, let's get it engraved
