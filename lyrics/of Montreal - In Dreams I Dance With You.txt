You remind me of a snowflake 
That falls while comets hit the earth, 
Destroying buildings and trees. 
But you are so light in the air, 
You never disrupt a thing. 

Orenda, if you were here 
I could walk through you, 
Orenda. 

In my bed at night I dream you're a ghost 
That only cats can see. 
Some nights you talk to me. 
Some nights you sing me to sleep, 
While moonlight showers the room. 

Orenda, if you were here 
I could walk through you, 
Orenda. 

In dreams I dance with you. 
We dance the best in the kitchen. 
While murderers and rapists surround the house. 
We don't care, 
Because our house is made of feathers. 
They wouldn't dare. 
In dreams I dance with you, 
Though our bodies are made out of wood.
