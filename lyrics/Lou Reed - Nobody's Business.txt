Hey, if you're moving too fast
don't you want this thing last
But if you start moving slow and -
hey, pretty mama, you just will have to go, because -

It's nobody's business but my own
It's nobody's business but my own
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no

But if you start acting mean
then I'll have to mess up the scene
But if you start treating me nice
hey, now baby, I'm gonna have to raise your price

Because it's nobody's business but my own
It's nobody's business but my own
No-no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no, no-no-no

Nobody's business
nobody's business, come on now
Hey, nobody's business, yeah, but my own
nobody's business, oh, my, no-no-no
Nobody's business, no-no-no-no-no
hey, nobody's business, yeah, but my own
Nobody's business, my own
no-no, no-no-no
No-no-no, no-no-no

Nobody's business
nobody's business
Nobody's business
nobody's business, but my own, now
