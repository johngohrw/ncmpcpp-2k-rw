Forced by the pressure,
The territories marked,
No longer the pleasure,
Oh, I've since lost the heart.

Corrupted from memory,
No longer the power,
It's creeping up slowly,
That last fatal hour.

Oh, I don't know what made me,
What gave me the right,
To mess with your values,
And change wrong to right.

Please keep your distance,
The trail leads to here,
There's blood on your fingers,
Brought on by fear.

I campaigned for nothing,
I worked hard for this,
I tried to get to you,
You treat me like this.

It's just second nature,
It's what we've been shown,
We're living by your rules,
That's all that we know.

I tried to get to you,
I tried to get to you,
I tried to get to you,
I tried to get to you.
