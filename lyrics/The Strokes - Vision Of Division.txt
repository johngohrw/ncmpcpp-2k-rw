Sing me a song you could be
Tell me a tale just like me
Don't turn it my way, happy and free
I'll turn it to shit, happy and free

Oh, all that I do, is wait for you
All that I do, is wait for you

I can't get along, with all your friends
Don't know how to act, that's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change but not in what way

How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?

I am not you, we could have
I'm almost through, great success
It's about time such a success
That you came through at no expense

Oh, all that I do, is wait for you
All that I do, is wait for you

I can't get away from all your friends
I'm not coming back, that's all there is
Why do I accept the things you say?
You know what to change but not in what way

How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
