Soothing repeat,
I look down at my feet,
It's a hypnotist's arm,
And it works like a charm.
But I won't be deprived,
Real worlds, surreal life,
Do or die,
There is time,
Go to sleep,
You'll be fine.

In the morning you'll find,
Real life was such a grind.
Off I go, day is done
Where a new one's just begun.
