Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
I met her walking down an uptown street
She's so fine I wish she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet
Talkin' bout you (nobody but you, baby)
Nobody but you (yes you all the time)
I do mean you (yeah my baby)
Just trying to get a message to you
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Help me know she looks so good
Lovely skin, well she's soaked in gin
She oughta be somewhere in Hollywood
Talkin' 'bout you (I'm talkin' 'bout my baby)
Nobody but you (yes she's alright)
I do mean you (yeah my baby)
Just trying to get a message to you
Talkin' 'bout you (nobody but you baby)
Nobody but you (yes you all the time)
I do mean you (yeah yeah)
Just trying to get a message to you
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Sitting right here by my side
Lovely indeed that why I ask if she
Promise someday she will be my bride
Talkin' 'bout you (yeah talk)
Nobody but you (yes my my baby)
I do mean you (yeah yeah)
I'm just trying to get a message through
Talkin' bout my baby...
