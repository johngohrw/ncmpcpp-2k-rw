Turn them out [?] find a place for a quite one
Suburbia got a yard
All this at stake for when I'm on the run
Run!

I know you're in there somewhere
Can't wait some, something you
Somewhere out there
Some Somewhere
Trying to love the
Trying to run the
Waiting
You don't have to be all by yourself
In the morning light
This'll all all be over with
I know you're in there somewhere
Can't outrun something you need
It's been so long
