[Scene 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candle light
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus:]
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside
It's late - is it just my sickly pride
Too late - even now the feeling seems to slip away

So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say
It's late It's late It's late
But not too late

[Scene 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time
The more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh you know that I can love you
Though you know I can't be true
