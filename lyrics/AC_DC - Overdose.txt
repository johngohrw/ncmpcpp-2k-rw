I never smoked me no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man don't ya understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me somethin' I never had
Pulled me down with you
Hit me up with a big hunka love
Hope you can pull me through
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

Woman you give to me
More 'n I can take
But listen honey
I don't mind
You're a habit I don't wanna break
Don't want me none of the harder stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in hell
And I'm sinkin' fast
And I don't need no cure
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

I'm as happy as a man can be
Too far gone to save
Died of love
And plenty of
Just write on my grave
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
There's nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

On you
On you
All over you
All over you
All over
I overdosed
Overdosed
Overdosed
On you
Overdosed
