Moon, Turn The Tides... Gently Gently Away
So down and down and down and down
And down and down we go
Hurry my darling we mustn't be late
For the show
Neptune champion games to an aqua
World is so very dear
Right this way smiles a mermaid
I can hear and man is full of cheer.

That man is full of cheer
I could hear that man is full of cheer
Lord thank you
