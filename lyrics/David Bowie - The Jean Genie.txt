A small Jean Genie
snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers 
and slash back blazers
Ate all your razors 
while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe 
and walking on Snow White 19
New York's a go-go 19
and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie

[CHORUS]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

Sits like a man 
but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but 
just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, 
won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician
and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair 
for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[CHORUS]

He's so simple minded 
he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

[CHORUS (x2)]
