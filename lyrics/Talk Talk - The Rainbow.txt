Oh yeah
The world's turned upside down
Jimmy Finn is out
Well how can that be fair at all

Lenient
The song the lawyer sang
Our nation's wrong

Well how can that be fair at all
Repented, changed
Aware where I have wronged

Unfound corrupt
This song the jailor sings
My time has run

Sound the victim's song
The trial is gone
The trial goes on

Sound the victim's song
