In time
You'll learn to say sorry
And I will play tender with you
In time
Your hands on my body will resonate through me
Like they did before
And then

I will be better
And we will be stronger
And you will be greater
The one that I always wanted you to be
If you can resist it
And make a commitment
And stay with me in this
Stay with me in this

[Chorus:]
(In time)
You'll be doing me right
I'm your girl in your light
When I'm holding you down
You be picking a fight
You've got a goddamn nerve
You've got a goddamn nerve
(In time)
I be feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
Everyday, everyday
You be testing my sane
(In time)
You've got a goddamn nerve
Everyday, everyday
You be testing my sane

The way you dismiss me
Will turn into missing me like I am yours
In time
The locks that you're turning will break
And you'll let me discover you more
And then

I won't be lonely
And you won't be silent
And we will be dancing
The way that we're wanting each other to be
If you could commit to
Making me happy
And stay with me in this
Stay with me in this

[Chorus:]
(In time)
You'll be doing me right
I'm your girl in your light
When I'm holding you down
You be picking a fight
You've got a goddamn nerve
You've got a goddamn nerve
(In time)
I be feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
Everyday, everyday
You be testing my sane
(In time)
You've got a goddamn nerve
Everyday, everyday
You be testing my sane

I've been feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
I've been feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
I've been feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
Everyday, everyday
I've been feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
I've been feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
I've been feeling the same
Everyday, everyday

(In time)
You've got a goddamn nerve
You've got a goddamn nerve
(In time)
I'll be feeling the same
In the club, in the rave
Everyday, everyday
You be testing my sane
(In time)
You've got a goddamn nerve
Everyday, everyday
You be testing my sane
