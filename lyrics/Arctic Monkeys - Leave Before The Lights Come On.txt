Well this is a good idea, 
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't, 
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one. 
Well my friend fancies you, 
Oh what a way to begin it all, 
You said, "It's always exciting words to hear" 

And we woke up together not quite realising how, 
Awkwardly stretching and yawning, 
Its always hard in the morning, 

And I suppose that's the price you pay, 
Well oh it isn't what it was, 
She's thinking he looks different today, 
And now there's nothing left to guess now, 

You left before the lights came on, 
Because they didn't want to ruin, 
What it was that was brewing, 
Before they absolutely had to, 
And how can you wake up, 
With someone you don't love? 
And not feel slightly fazed by it, 
Oh, he had a struggle, 

And they woke up together not quite realising how, 
Awkwardly stretching and yawning, 
It's always hard in the morning, 

And I suppose that's the price you pay, 
Well oh it isn't what it was, 
She's thinking he looks different today, 
And now there's nothing left to guess now, 

Quick, let's leave, before the lights come on, 
'Cos then you don't have to see, 
'Cos then you don't have to see, 
What you've done...

Quick, let's leave, before the lights come on, 
'Cos then you don't have to see, 
'Cos then you don't have to see, 
What you've done... 

I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come? [repeat]
