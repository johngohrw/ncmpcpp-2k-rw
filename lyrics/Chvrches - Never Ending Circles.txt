Throw me
No more bones and I will tell you no lies
This time
At least I am not so cold
You give me everything I never deserved
This time
You know I'll leave

Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another
Say you need another
Here's to never ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another
Say you need another

Cut off
I'll go my way if I'm going at all
This time
Believe that the strong red lines
That I will draw will come and cover you up
This time
You know I'll leave

Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another
Say you need another
Here's to never ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another
Say you need another

We are losing ground
It's time to save your neck
And I will try to find my feet and go
I am braced for words that never come
But I choose to decide that
I don't regret it
I don't regret it

Here's to taking what you came for
And here's to running off the pain
And here's to just another no man
If you want another
Say you need another
Here's to never ending circles
And building them on top of me
And here's to just another no man
If you want another
Say you need another
