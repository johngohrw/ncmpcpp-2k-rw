Late at night, gazing out into the late at night
I see deep in the world till I open my eyes
Every day brakes screech outside my window
Those crashing cars never seem to collide

Sometimes when I'm staring out my window
Catch the stars and watch as they go by
I've been getting messages from outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - it blows my mind

Every day I'm drawn to my window
I can hear it if I open my eyes

Sometimes flashing lights seem so familiar
I know I've seen them circling me at night
I've been sending signals tune to outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky - it blows my mind

Every day the restlessness takes over me
I can see it as I'm closing my eyes
I've been sending signals tune to outer space
They spiral like a finger in the sky

Like a finger in the sky...
