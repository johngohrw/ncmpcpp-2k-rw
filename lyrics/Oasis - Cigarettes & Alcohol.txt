Is it my imagination
Or have I finally found something worth living for?
I was looking for some action
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol 

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cos when it comes on top . . . 

You gotta make it happen! 

Is it worth the aggravation
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for?
It's a crazy situation
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol! 

You could wait for a lifetime
To spend your days in the sunshine
You might as well do the white line
Cos when it comes on top . . . 

You gotta make it happen!
