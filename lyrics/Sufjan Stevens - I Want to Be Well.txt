To think that I would die this time 
Isolated in the room where the bed rises 
Photographic ordinary people are everywhere
Extraordinary histories, ordinary histories, ordinary histories

I'll find sleep, I'll find peace, or in death you'll sleep with me.

To figure that it was my fault 
Or so I've come to realize life is not about 
Love with someone - (ordinary people are everywhere)
Extraordinary people are, ordinary people are, ordinary people are

Everywhere you look, everywhere you turn, illness is watching, waiting its turn.

Did I go at it wrong?
Did I go intentionally to destroy me?
I'm suffering in noise I'm suffering in - (touching ordinary body)
The burning from within the burning from with - (ordinary is scary now)
I could not be at rest, I could not be at peace - (extraordinary is scary now)

So do yourself a good, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes
Or do yourself a favor, or do yourself a death from ordinary causes

Endless lights prey upon the lonely, prey upon the lonely
Weightless lights, oh, I would rather be, but I would rather be fine

I want to be well, I want to be well, I want to be well, I want to be well.

And I forgive you even 
As you choke me that way 
With the pill or demon and the shrouding ?
Under conversation 
In tremendous weight of 
A crowd of ages outside 
Dressed for murder

I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around

And shall I kiss you even as you take me that way?
With the pill or demon as my body changes 
Apparitions gone awry 
They surround me, all sides 
From what am I seeing, only changes 

I'm not fucking around
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not fucking around
