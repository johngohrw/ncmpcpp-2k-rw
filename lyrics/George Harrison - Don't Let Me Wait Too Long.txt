How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long

How I love you baby
So don't let me wait too long

How I miss you baby
So don't let me wait too long

How I miss you baby
So don't let me wait too long

'Till you're here by my side
Now only you know how to dry up all
of those tears that I've cried

Here, with our love
Now only you know how to lay it down
like it came from above

You know it's you that I love

Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long
Now don't let me wait too long

Till you're here by my side
Now only you know how to dry eye up
all of those tears that I've cried

Here with your love
Now only you know how to lay it there
like it came from above

You know that it's you that I love

So don't let me wait too long
So don't let me wait too long

How I miss you baby
So don't let me wait too long

How I miss you baby
So don't let me wait,

Don't let me wait,
Don't let me wait too long
