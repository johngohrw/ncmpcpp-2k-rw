Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

[CHORUS]
Now your smile is wearing (spreading?) thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

[CHORUS]
Now your smile is wearing (spreading?) thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
