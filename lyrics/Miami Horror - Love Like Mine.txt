You wanna do this?
Okay

Across the river, hope to one day meet you
A thousand days go by I'm helpless on my own
I see the sun is coming down to greet you
And take my word, while history unfolds
Under the stars I'm thinking over
All the ways to get you off my mind
And I just can't get enough
Can't take it any longer
We're running out of time

And I say oh
You won't find a love like mine
And I say oh
You won't find a love like mine

Say now my heart is on the floor
Baby tell me that you want some more, more, more
If I was all you're looking for
Just tell me that you want some more, more, more

I walked a million miles away to see you
Feel the world panning in my eyes
I pinch myself and hope that I'm not dreaming
You're the only one, don't leave me in despair
I just sit here waiting for ya'
Hoping something better comes my way
And you can hold it up
I'm walking off that border
Across the moonlit bay

Just another play along
I can tell that you will never find a love like mine
And if you do I wish you well
All this time I never thought you'll find a love like mine

Say now my heart is on the floor
Baby tell me that you want some more, more, more
If I was all you're looking for
Just tell me that you want some more, more, more

You won't find a love like mine
You won't find a love like mine
You can't find a love like mine
You can't find a love like mine

And I say oh
You won't find a love like mine
And I say oh
You won't find a love like mine

Say now my heart is on the floor
Baby tell me that you want some more
(Tell me that you want some)
If I was all you're looking for
Just tell me that you want some more
(Just tell me now, just let my love run)
(Just tell me now, just let my love run)
(Just tell me now, just let my love run)
(Just tell me now, just let my love run)

You won't find a love like mine
You won't find a love like mine
You won't find a love like mine
You won't find a love like mine
