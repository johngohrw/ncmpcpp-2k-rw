I came apart inside a world made of angry people
I found a boy who had a dream
Making everyone smile
He was sunshine
I fell over my feet
Like bricks underwater

How am I supposed to tell you how I feel
I need oxygen
Oh baby if I was your lady?
I would make you happy
I'm never gonna leave, never gonna leave
Oh baby I will be your lady
I am going crazy for you

And so I found a state of mind
Where I could be speechless
I had to try it for a while
To figure out this feeling
This felt so right
Pull me upside down to a place
Where you've been waiting

How am I supposed to tell you how I feel
I need oxygen
Oh baby if I was your lady
I would make you happy
I'm never gonna leave,
Never gonna leave
Oh baby I will be your lady
I am going crazy for you

And you don't wanna keep me waiting
Staring at my fingers feeling like a fool

Oh baby I will be your lady
I will make you happy
I'm never gonna leave,
Never gonna leave
Oh baby I will be your lady
I'm going crazy, yeah-oh

Tell me what you want,
Baby tell me what you need
Anything I ask baby give it to me
Baby give it to me, give it to me

I came apart inside a world made of angry people
I found a boy who had a dream
Making everyone smile
