I'm taking my ride with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all ment to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see
Oh I know, I know, I know that it's true
Yes it's really ment to be
Deep in my heart

I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really ment to be
Yeah, yeah
When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies break through behin the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever

I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving in all my soul

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all ment to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really ment to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so
Yes it was plain to see, yes it was ment to be
Written in the stars...
Written in the stars...
