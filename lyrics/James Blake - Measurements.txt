Please fall down
Testing sounds for the death of the forest cold
Trees in clouds testing doubt trying not to be too old
Please you're pride, telling lies, that you're not on your own
Watching them, faith in prayers, will make you see your bones

Please fall down
Testing sounds for the sound of the death and the sound of the forest cold
Trees in clouds testing doubt trying not to be too old
Please your pride, telling lies that you're not on your own
Watching them, faith in prayers, will make you see your bones

Please fall down testing sounds for the death 
And the fall of the forest cold
Trees in clouds testing doubts trying not to be too old
Please your pride, telling lies that you're not own your own
Watching them, faith in prayers, won;t make you see your bones

Please fall down testing sounds, for the death and the forest cold
Trees in clouds testing doubts trying not to be too old
Please your pride, telling lies that you're on your own
Watching them, faith in prayers will make you see your bones
