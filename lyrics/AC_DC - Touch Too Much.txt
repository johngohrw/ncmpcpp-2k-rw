It was one of those nights when you turn off the lights
And everythin' comes into view
She was takin' her time I was loosin my mind
There was nothin' that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last
She knew we was makin' love
I was so satisfied, deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body
Too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She got a touch
A touch too much

She had the face of an angel smilin' with sin
The body of Venus with arms
Dealin' with danger strokin' my skin
Like a thunder and lightnin' storm
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard, wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body
Too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She had a touch
A touch too much
Touch me
Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much (much too much)
I really wanna feel ya (touch too much)
Girl you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much too much too much too much
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
Givin' me a touch (a touch too much)
Lay me down and touch (a touch too much)
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
A touch too much, a touch too much, a touch too much
Touch
Come on and touch me
Yeah
