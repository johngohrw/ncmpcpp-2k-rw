Soft overripe fresh skeezed California females
With 3-inch cherry red press-on Lee nails
Reach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seeking
Like a garbage bag full overflowing now it's leaking
Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair
So I can climb up and get into your underwear
Rat soup eating test cheating no business punk
You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk
You've gone wet look crazy and messed with your head
You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
You're all mixed up like pasta primavera
Why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera man
Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor
So get that money out of your ass you whore
I brought her upstairs onto the roof
I dogged your wife and she is a doofus
What goes around, comes around

Clean B cleaning the G spot you know that we've got
Dolemite's house and you have not
Look out my window look over the city
With two black eyes your girl ain't that pretty
Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat
Why you wanna treat your girl like that
Living in the rat race smoking rat weed
You reap what you sow when you plant the seed
Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Got more Louie than Phil Rizzuto
What goes around, comes around

Funky Pam, F.P.
