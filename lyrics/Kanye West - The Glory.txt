"I got fury in my soul,
fury's gonna take me to the glory goal.
In my mind I can't study war no more."

Gonna take you to the glory
Oh I can't study war
Yeah

Now where the west side
I can't study war
Yep

Uh

Can I talk my shit again?
Even if I don't hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch, with Donatello Versace,
That's Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy, I drank I'm gone on that Bacardi Lemon, Corona, I'm zoning
Class back in session so I up't it a grade
Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade
And A
Please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all brides maids catch the garter
On nights when romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy
I did it for the glory

[chorus sample]

I can't study war
No no
I can't study war
No no
The glory
I can't study war
No no
I can't study war
I did it for the glory
I can't study war
No no I can't study war
No no I can't study war
I did it for the glory
No no I can't study war
No no I can't study war
The glory
No no
I can't study war
Uh

What am I supposed to do now?
Man the game all messed up
How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo
But with my ego, I can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic
Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone big pun big l or notorious
Fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit

[chorus sample]

No no I can't study war
Yeah I'm gonna start killin' these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I can't study war
No no

No no I can't study war
