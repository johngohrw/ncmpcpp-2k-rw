My, my
You busted me
Like a Robocop, strike me
With your riding crop
I'm forever going celibate tomorrow
But tonight, like success, knows no shame

Oh no, she's a rejector
I must protect myself

There's the girl that left me bitter
Want to pay some other girl
To just walk up to her and hit her
But I can't, I can't, I can't

My, my
This demon heart
Of the master's hand, crush me
Why, I don't understand
And I know you're not her
'Cause the girl of my dreams is probably god
Still, I want you
