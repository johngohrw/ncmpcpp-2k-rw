Cold fire, you've got everything 
but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tired
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart in pieces

[CHORUS]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might 
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

[CHORUS]

One day though it might
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star
