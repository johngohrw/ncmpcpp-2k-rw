When you come around, everything else disappears.
My ears disappear.
When you come around, everything else vanishes.

The crowds slowly fade when you come around.
Everything evaporates when you come around.

On the news at night,
they talk about the disappearances.
They interview the people who were witnesses.
Most are shocked, some don't care.

When you come around, everything else disappears.
My mouth disappears.
When you come around, everything else vanishes.

The birds have no heads when you come around.
Everything loses its legs when you come around.

On the news at night,
they talk about the abnormalities.
They interview the people who are authorities.
Most are intrigued, some don't care
When you come around.

When you are near,
I feel so far away from the person I am
Alone I feel like I'm jumping on a trampoline.

When you come around, everything else disappears.
My eyes disappear.
When you come around, everything else vanishes.

The sunlight swims away when you come around,
And even darkness won't stay
when you come around.
