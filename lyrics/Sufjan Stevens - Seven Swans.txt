We didn't sleep too late
There was a fire in the yard
All of the tress were in light
They had no faces to show

I saw a sign in the sky
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
I heard a voice in my mind
I will try, I will try, I will try

I will try, I will try, I will try

We saw the dragon move down
My father burned into coal
My mother saw it from far
She took her purse to the bed

I saw a sign in the sky
Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns
I heard a voice in my mind
I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord

He said, I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord
He said, I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord

He will take you
If you run, He will chase you
He will take you
If you run, He will chase you

'Cause He is the Lord
'Cause He is the Lord

Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans
