Montains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not down
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die 
La la la la la la la la la la [x2]
La la la la la [x2]
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
Child of the Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
