You're such a mystery
I just want to stand and stare
Nibble on your ear
And smell the ocean in your hair (Ocean in your hair, ocean in your hair)
I know you damage me
You leave me tangled in a knot (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
But when you reappear
I see Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Eyes forgot)
Neptunian blues that eyes forgot (Blues that eyes forgot, eyes forgot)

Still, I only feel alive when the VU is flashing
Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should sit down
No sense in cashing us now
Yeah, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
The party's crashing us now
The party's crashing us now

Oh, well, we made love
Like a pair of black wizards
You freed me from the past
You fucked the suburbs out of me (The suburbs out of me)
And all those ugly days
That made us so sick (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
They are just fossils now
We've learned the elevating trick (Elevating trick, elevating trick)
We've learned the elevating trick (Elevating trick, elevating trick)

Still, I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should come down
No sense in cashing us now
Still, I only feel alive when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
The party's crashing us now
The party's crashing us now

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh

I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
Alarms going off in my head
I want to grab you, want to scream at you, no icing me down
The party's crashing us now
I only feel all right when the VU is flashing
And bombs going off in my head
I want to grab you and just kiss you
Maybe I should come down
No sense in cashing us now

The party's crashing us now
