So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman, a blind woman pacin' up and down the sidewalk.
She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it.
So after watching her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something.
I would like to help you find it. She replied, "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life"
