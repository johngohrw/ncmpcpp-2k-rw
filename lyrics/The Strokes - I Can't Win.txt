That was you up on the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting
1 - 2 tries won't do it
You do it all your life and you never get through it
Everything they had to say
Had been erased in just one day

"Good try
We don't like it"
"Good try
We won't take that shit."

I can't win.

Things in bars that people do
When no one wants to talk to you
Failing can be quite a breeze, he
Told me that these girls were easy
Happy that you said you'd mount me
Felt unlucky when you found me
Some nights come up empty handed

Yes, I'll take it

Wait now
By the sidewalk
Hold on
Yes, I'll be right back.

I can't win.

Yeah, I
Wait for something
"Cool it
We won't take that shit"
"Good try
We don't like it"
-Hold on,
Yes, I'll be right back.
