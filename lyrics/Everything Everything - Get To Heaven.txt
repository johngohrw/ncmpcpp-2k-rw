Out in the cold
There’s an old man laying down in the flames tonight
Smiling to me
And he whistles as they’re sweeping him up, alright
Like

I hear them praying

(We can get to that heaven!)
There’s bodies in the road
(We can get to that heaven!)
Where nothing else will grow
(Lunatic in my bedroom!)
I’m thinking: "What was my password?"
As the vultures land

Crushed under feet
How about we find some nice place to eat tonight?
Teeth on a wire
I made a necklace for you
Just you and I, alright
Like

I hear them burning

(We can get to that heaven!)
There’s bodies in the road
(We can get to that heaven!)
Where nothing else will grow
(Lunatic in my bedroom!)
I’m thinking: "What was my password?"
As the vultures land

(We can get to that heaven!)
As the tanks roll by
(We can get to that heaven!)
Under a blood black sky
(Lunatic in my bedroom!)
I’m thinking: "Where in the blazes
Did I park my car?"
