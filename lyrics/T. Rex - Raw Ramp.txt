Baby I've got metal knees ooh.
Lady I'm beggin' of you please
Baby you think you're a champ but
Girl you ain't nothin' but a raw ramp.
Lady, your lips are the most
Baby, your mouth is like a ghost
Lady, you think you're a champ but
Girl you ain't nothin' but a raw ramp.

Woman, I love your chests ooh,
Baby, I'm crazy 'bout your breasts
Woman, you think you're a champ but
Girl you ain't nothin' but a raw ramp
Baby I've got metal knees ooh.
Lady I'm beggin' of you please
Baby you think you're a champ but
Girl you ain't nothin' but a raw ramp.

Baby, I love your chests ooh,
Lady, I'm crazy 'bout your breasts
Woman, you think you're a champ but
Girl you ain't nothin' but a raw ramp
You ain't nothin' but a raw ramp......

Standin' on a corner by my old high school,
I let this female call me a fool
I got on my knees and begged to the sun
And I knew that my manhood had begun
Boogie on, electric boogie, boogie on
Embrace your brother, dance in the mud
Like a Palamino stud
Come along hold my hand.
