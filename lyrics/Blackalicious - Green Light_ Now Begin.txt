[Chorus:]
Green light, now begin
Green light oh-way
Ee-yah-oh-way [x3]
Green light, now begin
Green light oh way
Ee-yah-oh-way [x3]
Green light, now begin

The verb annihilator pen, every animator blend
Thought exaggerate a win, comin' at ya made ya thin
Diabolically I grin as I'm frolicking within your anatomy again
Makin' people higher into infinity from sin where your remedy
For them who are feelin' where your friends don't intend to be
A trend but a symphony of hymns lyrics sent to me
From Him I extend to thee the tims of intensity
Lend your attention see is whence your invisions
Of a mental division full of internalisms and again and again
I'm gonna win this division we a men on a mission, green light now begin

[Chorus]

No more of that sittin' in a slump and uh
No more of that coulda-woulda-shoulda junk (nope)
No more of that waiting for the inspiration, innovation
Or a green light--now begin
No more of that lettin' all your time pass (uh-uh)
No more petty illusions of the mindless (nope)
It's time to expand, power from within, you're takin' over this dominion
Green light, now begin

I be the heat of the night (don't fear the leader?)
I'm hear to strike light reveal the meteorite
Eating your readings and pens bleeding intense feeling
Appealing sentence in dents in just reeling 'em in
I'm merely a chameleon amid your elementary
Elements of the century tell 'em that it was me that sent ya
Tell 'em a-visually they'll be in to me until they sleep
And hell I'm an entity bailin' well and a felon, I'm free
Millin' and rousin' and I'm (rollin' and killin'?) from filtering
Hell of intelligent diligent heaven-sent benevolent relevant medicine
Poetry pedestrian peddelin' mad adrenaline to lyrical gentlemen
Okay?
Alright

[Chorus]
