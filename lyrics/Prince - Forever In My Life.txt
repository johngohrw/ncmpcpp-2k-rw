There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down 2 the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want 2 settle down
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell U that I wanna with U (baby, if U do 2)
And baby if U do 2
Forever, forever, baby I want U forever
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U can make right)
All that is wrong in my world (U are my saviour)
U can make right (U are my light)
U are my saviour, U are my light (Forever I want U in my life)
Forever I want U in my life

(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey (don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid 2 walk on his own (I'm at that road)
I'm here 2 tell U that I'm at that road (I'd rather walk it with)
And I'd rather walk it (U than walk it alone)
with U than walk it alone (U are my future)
U are my hero, U are my future (no past)
When I am with U, I have no past
Oh baby my one and only desire (make this feelin' last)
Is find some way in this doggone world (sugar it's true)
2 make this feelin' last (I know I do)
Oh baby it's true, I know I do (2 with U)
And I just wanna tell U that I
want 2 with U, yeah
And baby if U do 2
Forever, forever, I want U baby, baby forever (U can make right)
I wanna keep U 4 the rest of my life (U are my saviour)
All that is wrong in my world (U are my light)
U can make right (Forever I want U in my life)
U are my saviour, U are my light (La da da da da da da da)
Forever I want U in my life (La da da da da da da da)

Forever in my life [repeated to fade]
