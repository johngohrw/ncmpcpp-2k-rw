It's been a long time, since I've spoken to you
was it the right time
Your current troubles, and you know, they'll get much worse
I hope you know how much you enjoy them
You're a pig of a person, If there's a justice in this world
hey, how about that
Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality
well, more and more people know all about it

Do you remember that song by a dude named Bobby Fuller
It went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

We sat around the other night, me and the guys
trying to find the right word
That would best fit and describe
you people like that
That no principle has touched, no principle's baptized
how about that
They'd  eat shit and say it tasted good
if there was some money in it for them

Hey, you remember that song about this guy from Texas
Whose name was --- Bobby Fuller
I'll sing it for you, it went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

You're just dirt
You're just dirt, The only word for you is dirt
That's the only word that -

- hurt, You're just dirt
That's all you're worth - cheap, cheap dirt
You know they call it -
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
you're just - cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
You're just dirt - nothing but - cheap uptown dirt
That's all you're worth - It's just - cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
That's all you're worth now (cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
You're just dirt (cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
