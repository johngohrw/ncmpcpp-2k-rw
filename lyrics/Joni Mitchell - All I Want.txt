I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh i hate you some, I hate you some
I love you some
I love you when I forget about me
I want to be strong I want to laugh along
I want to belong to the living
Alive, alive, want to get up and jive
wreck my stockings in some juke box dive
Do you want- do you want- do you want
to dance with me baby
do you want to take a chance
on maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby
well come on

All I really really want our love to do
is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really really want our love to do
is to bring out the best in me and in you
and renew you again and again
Applause, applause- Life is our cause
When I think of your kisses
my mind see-saws
do you see- do you see- do you see
how you hurt me baby
so I hurt you too
then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
I tell you it's the unraveling
and it undoes all the joy that could be
And I just want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun
want to be the one that you want to see
want to knit you a sweater
and want to write you a love letter
want to make you feel better
want to make you feel
Hmm, Hmm, Hmm, Hmm,
Want to make you feel
I want to make you feel
