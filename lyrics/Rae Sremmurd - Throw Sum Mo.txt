Hi, bye hater, I flood the club with paper
Shorty got an ass some for now and some for later, (delicious)
Something like Nicki’s, dancin’ like Maliah
How I'm throwing all this money, I’ma fuck around and buy her
I can flick the money all night til’ my wrist tired (tired)
If you put in work, this the night you gon' retire (retire)
You a bad bitch, I ain't even gon' deny ya
She told me throw that money, I said make it worth my while
I'm bout’ to empty out the ATM, (throw it throw it throw it)
She doin’ tricks that make a nigga wanna spend, (blow it, blow it)
Girl you know you got me fascinated,
Just keep on dancin' til I'm outta paper, (never)

Hold up, hold on, her eyes on me
Is that your hoe, if so, I’ma get her before the nights over
DJ playin' my shit so I'm finna crank up off in the VIP zone
See the money go up and she dance on site
By the end of the night she on end though

Let me see you get low like limbo, (work)
