Who saw those dark eyes
Who saw those dark eyes
These years gone by
Deep within
Burn my skin
All those years gone by
In the heat of the night
All those years gone by
 
Who felt those cold hands
Who felt those cold hands
Touch my skin
Deep within
Burn my soul
Fell to the ground
Where I was found
All those years ago
All those tears ago
All those years ago
 
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Even me
Just be free
This is a place
Where in the end
It happens in
Our world within
 
Time to go
Time to go
