Lyin', cheatin', hurtin, that's all you seem to do. 
Messin' around with every guy in town, 
Puttin' me down for thinkin' of someone new. 
Always the same, playin' your game, 
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you, 
One of these days and it won't be long, 
You'll look for me but baby, I'll be gone. 
This is all I gotta say to you woman: 

[Chorus]
Your Time Is Gonna Come [X4]

Made up my mind to break you this time, 
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry. 
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt. 
It's fadin' away, can't feel you anymore. 
Don't care what you say 'cause I'm goin' away to stay, 
Gonna make you pay for that great big hole in my heart. 
People talkin' all around, 
Watch out woman, no longer 
Is the joke gonna be on my heart. 
You been bad to me woman, 
But it's coming back home to you. 

[Chorus]
