I'm locked inside
A land called foolish pride
Where the man is always right
He hates to talk but loves to fight
Is that alright?

On real cold days
He loans us lots of hate
But he says that we must pay
To take it all away
Is that ok?

But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know it's rough
And you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy

And when I look into the future I see danger in its eyes
Hearts of hatred rule the land while love is left aside
Killing plagues the citizens while music slowly dies
I get frightened, I
See, I get frightened, I...

Oh how, oh how I need you baby
To keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay

Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay

She's quick to fight
For her man but not her rights
Even though it's 3005
When will we end this genocide?
And that's not right
Her children cry
No food to eat and afraid as flies
The color black means it's time to die
And nobody questions why
Cause they're too scared to stop the man

But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know it's rough
And you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy

When I look into the future
I see danger in its eyes
Babies die before they're born
And no one ever smiles
The writers and the artists, all are paid to tell us lies
To keep us locked inside, they keep us locked inside

Oh how, oh how I need you baby
To keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay

Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby
Need you to stay

I can make a change
I can start a fire
Lord, make me love again
Fill me with desire

I can make a change
I can start a fire
Make me love again
Lord, thank You for desire

And when I look into your pretty eyes I almost want to cry
I think about my life and I don't want to live a lie
How I need you baby, I need you right by my side
I need you tonight, I need you tonight

Yeah! How I need you baby
See I can't let you go, I need you
On the other side
On the other side

I love you so and I'll never let you go
On the other side!
