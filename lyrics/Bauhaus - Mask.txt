I'm lost!

The man of shadows thinks in clay 
Dreamed trapped thoughts of suffocation days
He's seen in iron environments 
With plastic sweat out of chiselled slits for eyes 

From the growth underneath the closed mouth 
You'll catch if you listen 
Rack-trapped cubist vowels 
From a dummy head expression 
From a dummy head expression 

The transformation is invested 
With the mysterious and the shameful 
While the thing I am becomes something else 
Part character part sensation 

The shadow is cast
