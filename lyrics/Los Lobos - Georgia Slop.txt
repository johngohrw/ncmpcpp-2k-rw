Way down south where I make my stop
They do a dance down there called the Georgia Slop
They all hang out at Peg Leg Lee's
And they don't give a hoot about no police
Peg Leg Lee's is where I'm talking about
They knocked down, kicked, and dragged 'em out

They get paid on Friday when their work's all done
And they all do it up 'til Monday comes
When they do the Slop they turn loose hands
And move like a chicken when he's scratching in the sand
Shuffle your feet and spin like a top
Shake shake shake the Georgia Slop

I stopped to get a soda and dig that jive
I met a chick, she weighed 385
I started lookin' and I couldn't stop
She and I got together and did the Georgia Slop

Peg Leg Lee's is where I'm talking about
They knocked down, kicked, and dragged 'em out
Do it baby, do it baby, do it baby, do it baby
To the right, to the left
Oh baby, yah do it baby
