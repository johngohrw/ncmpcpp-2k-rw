I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms

It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean
(Yours is the only ocean)
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on

I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Oh she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd still spend it chasing after you
Cos she's not shattering my attitude
No matter how she folds the potion

Yours is the only ocean
That I want to swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

I'm swinging on
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean
Yours is the only ocean

Potion Approaching
Shield your eyes
Potion Approaching
Visualize
Holding a token
Swollen in size
Potion Approaching
Shield your eyes

Oh but if we're going to escape though
We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go kart?
