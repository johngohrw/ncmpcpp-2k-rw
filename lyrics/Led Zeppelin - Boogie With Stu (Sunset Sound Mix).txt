Been in town, my baby, We just got to rock on 
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home 
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock. 

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, honey 
We've been shakin' all night 
Oh, darlin', we just got to roll right 
Ooh, my head... rock on. 

Hey babe, hey babe [repeat]

I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop 
Come on baby, just rock, rock, rock.
