I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)
(Ball so hard, boys for sex)

Wishing you Godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

(This love will keep us still blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
Until the time...
(This love will keep people blinded of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)
'Till the time we die...
(This love will keep us still blinded by the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind)

Oh-oh, ohhh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, ohhh
