I'm gonna pull you in close
I'm gonna wrap you up tight
I'm gonna play with the braids that you came here with tonight
I'm gonna hold your face, and toast the snow that fell
Because friends don't waste wine when there's words to sell

I feel like love is in the kitchen with a culinary eye
I think he's making something special
And I'm smart enough to try
If you don't trust yourself for at least one minute each day,
Well you should trust in this, girl, cause loving is coming our way.

If you can fix me up we'll go a long way
If you can fix me up, girl, we'll go a long way.

(Take my love in real small doses.)

I will stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
It takes a long time just to get this all straight.
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
In my mind, this is my free-time
Because friends don't waste wine when there's words to sell.

(Take my love in real small doses)

I will stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
But I've spent a long time corresponding in my own way.
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place
But it takes a long time just to get this all straight
In my mind, this is my free time...

To let it all away
Spend it all today
Spend it all today
It took time then I found you.
