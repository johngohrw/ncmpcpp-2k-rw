It sure was a long long long hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see
Well my heart was way down
In a cold cold winter storm.

Well my darlin' where can you be?
Where can you be baby?
Where can you be?

There were three sugar walls and a two candy cane windows
But the serious mood melted ah all those insight
Everybody's on fire but I'm uh snowin' in a cold blizzard.

Where are you on this ah hot cold summer?
Where are you on this ah hot cold summer?
Where are you on this ah hot cold summer night?

Around about this time the telephone blew it's horn across the room
Scared little Annie clean out of her mind and I tell ya
Roman the Candle he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek
And grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time
And the telephone keeps on screamin'.
Yeah yeah yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Hello said my shakey voice, well how you doin'
I start to stutter
Ah can't cha tell I'm ah doin' fine
Do was my baby talkin' she's way down 'cross the border.

She says I'm gonna hurry to ya I've been a fool
And I'm tired of cryin'
Said I'm tired of cryin'.

Yeah a long long hot summer night
As far as my eyes could see
But I can ah feel the heat comin' on as my baby's gettin' closer.

I'm so glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me
So glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me
So glad my baby's comin' to rescue me
Rescue, rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue
Rescue, rescue, What'd I say
Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue, rescue me, rescue me
Rescue
