Now once upon a time - an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone - and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies to find a new destination - that is the sign
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

He gives a great big cry and he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies - the palm of his hand is incredible
One great big eye - has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah
Come tonight
Come to the ogre sight
Come to the ogre-battle-fight

The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
"Keep a look out"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind you and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, the trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
