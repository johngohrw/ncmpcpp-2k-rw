My poor broke mama told me 
When I was twelve years old 
You eat and talk much too fast 
There's one thing you should know 
Take your time my sweet baby 
Take your time my blue eyed son 
Well you may never have his money 
But you won't miss no rich man's fun 
I can never give you money honey 
I can never buy you clothes 
But the way them women been lookin' at you 
Someday you should have both 
If you take your time my sweet baby 
Take your time and love them slow 
And if you play your cards right 
You won't never wait no more 

Well the ladies like their diamonds 
They like their brand new clothes 
But I was blessed with plenty of other things they love the most 
I take my time with the ladies 
I take my time and I love 'em slow 
And since I turned thirteen 
Lord, I ain't never wait no more 

I can never give you money honey 
I can never buy you clothes 
But the way them schoolgirls look at you 
Someday you should have both 
If you take your time my sweet baby 
Take your time and be my son 
Well you might never have his money 
But you won't miss his fun
