That's not what I meant to say at all
I mean, I'm sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you

But that's not what I wanted to say at all
I mean, I'm sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you

(Is it the Chorus yet?  No, it's just the building of the verse, so when the chorus does come, it'll be more rewarding.)
I would speak to you in song
But you can't sing
As far as I'm aware
Though everyone can sing
As you are well aware
I keep so quiet
It's hard to tell I'm alive

Everybody's swinging their hips
Everybody's giving the waitress tips
Everybody's dancing all of the dances
Everybody's dancing every dance now

Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them

I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There's no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other
They're just two normal people

(These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with) [x2]

But if you keep giving me your empty hands man I am tempted to say
Let's piss up another rope boys this one has grown old and bitter

Well, so what?  So what?
We're young
We're thin (most of us)
We're alive (most of us)

Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart any second?
I am terrified your body call fall apart at any second
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
We can get real horny and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my place

I know that I don't talk a lot
But I know that you don't care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We'll forget that we forgot how to talk
When we dance

Don't you realize our bodies could fall apart any second?
I am terrified your body call fall apart at any second
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
We can get real horny and keep messing around
We can keep real quiet won't be making no sounds
I'll try my best not touch your face
Next time can we please meet at my place

When we dance
