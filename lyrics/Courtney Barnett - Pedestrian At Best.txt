I love you I hate you I'm on the fence it all depends whether I'm up I'm down I'm on the mend trendsetting on reality I like you despise you admire you what are we gonna do when everything all falls through I must confess I've made a mess of what should be a small success but I digress at least I've tried my very best I guess this that the other why even bother it wont be with me on my death bed but ill still be in your head

put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
you tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
give me all your money and I'll make some origami honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

my internal monologue is saturated analog it's scratched and drifting I've become attached to the idea it's all a shifting dream bittersweet philosophy I've got no idea how I even got here I'm resentful I'm having an existential time crisis what bliss daylight savings wont fix this mess under worked and oversexed I must express my disinterest the rats are back inside my head what would Freud've said

put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
you tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
give me all your money and I'll make some origami honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

I want to wash out my head with turpentine cyanide I dislike this internal diatribe when I try to catch your eye I hate seeing you crying in the kitchen I don't know why it makes me like this when you're not even mine to consider erroneous harmonious I'm hardly sanctimonious dirty clothes I suppose we all outgrow ourselves I'm a fake I'm a phony I'm awake I'm alone I'm homely I'm a Scorpio

put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
you tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
give me all your money and I'll make some origami honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny

put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint
you tell me I'm exceptional and I promise to exploit you
give me all your money and I'll make some origami honey
I think you're a joke but I don't find you very funny
