In this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further and further 
From the world 
We must do 

I saw you asleep beside a wall 
Your skull inside a ball 
Your eyes blackened by 
The sound and the thought of God 
Where should I hang my head?
Where would you like for me to hang my head?

One absence of truth 
And one horrible thing I saw 
What you truly wanted to become 
And who you thought I was
The fall, the fall
Afraid to love
What is deeper than the grave
Goes all the way down those tracks
Everybody bow your head for the greatest inspiration
Complete contradiction
Away

In this hole that we have fixed 
We get further and further 
From the world 
We must do 
I know this, I know this
You know this, you know this

In this hole that we have fixed 
We get further and further and further
From the world 
We must do 

I saw you outside that wall 
Your skull outside that wall 
Your eyes perceived by the sound 
And the light of God
