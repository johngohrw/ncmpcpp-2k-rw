[V1:]
The little things, you do to me are
Taking me over, I wanna show ya
Everything inside of me
Like a nervous heart that, is crazy beating
My feet are stuck here, against the pavement
I wanna break free, I wanna make it
Closer to your eyes, get your attention
Before you pass me by

[Chorus:]
(back up, back up) take another chance,
Don't you (mess up, mess up) I don't wanna lose you
(wake up, wake up) this ain't just a thing that you
(give up, give up) don't you say that I'd be
Better off better off, sleeping by myself and wondering
If I'm better off better off, with out you boy

[V2:]
And every time, you notice me by
Holding me closely, and saying sweet things
I don't believe, that it could be
You speaking your mind and, saying the real thing
My feet have broke free, and I am leaving
I'm not gonna stand here, feeling lonely but
I don't regret it, and I won't think this
Was just a waste of time

[Chorus]

Don't just leave, me, hanging on [repeat]

[Verse 1]

Don't just leave me hanging on

[Chorus]

(back up, back up) take another chance,
Don't you (mess up, mess up) I don't wanna lose you
(wake up, wake up) this ain't just a thing that you
(give up, give up) don't you say that I'd be
Better off, better off sitting by myself & wondering (don't just leave me hanging on)
If I'm better off, better off without you boy (don't just leave me hanging on)

Don't just leave me hanging on [repeat 'til end]
