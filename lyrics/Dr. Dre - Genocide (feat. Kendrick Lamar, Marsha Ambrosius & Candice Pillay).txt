[Marsha Ambrosius:]
Stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
Murder, murder
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder
Murder

[Candice Pillay:]
My daddy done killed a bitch
Went and put that dome to her head
My daddy done killa you
Don't feel a pull a part that man and
(Let me up!) What it look like?
See my daddy done kill 'em dead
Bullets come down from the earth
My daddy done killa you
Don't feel a pull a part that man and
(Let me up!) What it look?

(It's been a 187 in this bitch!)
Murderess, murder listen, hit a suburban whippin'
Tinted windows ride at your wifey (Blah!) and I bet you miss her
Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways
Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timelined
Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's hot grinds
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep ‘em thighs high
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area
I'm very aware that hip hop needed somethin' to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is hub city nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Ahh, recognize whatever side the sides reside until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings
I ride, I'mma ride in a stolen jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they payed me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, raiders in black
Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one way street
Nowhere to go, death all I can see
I say "Fuck is up?", I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or somethings up
I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke
Plenty ruckus with the weapon I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life
Fuck your hope, fuck your mama
Fuck your daddy, fuck you dead homie
Fuck the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!

Murder, murder
Murder
Murder
It's all murder
Murder

Murder, murder
Murder, murder
It's been a murder
(It's been a 187 in this bitch!)
