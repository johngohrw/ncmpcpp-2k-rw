I can see that you're rubbing off
on everyone you know.
You're rubbing off on me,
I can feel your incredible glow.
I can hear your happy voice in other people's voices.
I can hear your beautiful voice sometimes when I speak.

You've got a special gift.
Do you see how you're changing the world
just by hanging around?

I can see how you sweetened up

both of your grumpy roommates.
Now they even say hello
when we pass on the street.
I find joy in simple things ever since I met you.
I never get the chance just to tell you
how out of sight you are.

You've got a special gift.
Do you see how you're changing the world
just by hanging around?
