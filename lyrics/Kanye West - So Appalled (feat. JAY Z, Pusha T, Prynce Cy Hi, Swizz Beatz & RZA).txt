[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don’t really care
two hands in the air if you don’t really care
it’s like that sometimes I mean ridiculous
it’s like that sometimes the shit’s ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don’t really care
middle finger in the air if you don’t really care
it’s like that sometimes, man ridiculous
life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Kanye West:]
I’m so appalled
Spalding balled,
Balled in and Donald Trump taking dollars from yall
Baby your fire and your girlfriend hired
And if you don’t mind, I’ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don’t give a fuck by yall
I got dogs that chew a fuckin’ hole through the wall
But since they all lovers
I need more rubbers
And if I don’t use rubbers, need more covers
House keeping, I mean gawd damn one time
Let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O’s like Cheerios
That know cuz they seen us in the videos
That know, the day that you play me
Will be the same day MTV play videos
that was a little joke, Voila!
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby Im magic, Tadah!
Address me as your highness
High as United, 30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writin’ bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas going through real shit, man they outta work
That’s why I never gawd damn dance track, gotta hurt
That’s why I rather spit something that gotta perch
Champagne wishes, 30 white bitches
I mean the shit is, fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous, I mean the shit is
Fucking ridiculous

[Pusha T:]
5 star dishes, different exotic fishes
man this shit is, fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous

[Jay-Z:]
How should I begin this
I’m just so offended
how am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I’m so appalled I might buy the mall
just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I’m fresher than you all
so I don’t have to pause
all of y’all can suck my balls through my draws
dark knight feeling, die or be a hero
or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favourite to the most hated
or would you rather be underpaid or over-rated?
moral victories is for minor league coaches
and ‘Ye already told you "We Major" you cockroaches
show me where the boats is, Ferrari testarossa’s
the Hammer went broke so you know I’m more focused
I lost thirty mill so I spent another 30
cuz unlike Hammer 30 mill can’t hurt me
fucking insane, the fuck am I sayin’
not only am I fly, I’m fucking not playing
all these little bitches too big for their britches
burning their little bridges
fucking ridiculous

[Kanye West:]
champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean the shit is fucking ridiculous

I mean the shit is fucking ridiculous

[Pusha T:]
5 star dishes, different exotic fishes

[Pusha T:]
Success is what you make it
take it how it come
a half a mill in twenties is like a bill where I’m from
an arrogant drug dealer the legend I’ve become
CNN said I’d be dead by 21
black jack I just pulled in aces
you looking at the king in his face
everything I dream muthafuckers Im watching it take shape
while to you I’m just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove leather roof
love war fuck a truce
still move a bird like I’m in bed with mother goose
them hoes come in a bakers dozen
claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn’t
I keep the city’s best never said she was the brightest
so if you had it too, it don’t affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn’t need a little guidance
so I dismiss her past until she dissappoint your highness

I speak the gospel, hostel
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
paranoid mind I’m still under the watchful
eye of the law, aspire for more
them kilo’s came we gave you bobby brown jaw
flaws aint flaws when it’s you that makes the call
flow similar to the legend of the falls
spillin’ I own you all, yeah

[CyHi Da Prynce:]
5 star dishes, different exotic fishes

[CyHi Da Prynce:]
I am so outrageous,
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
if God had an iPod, I’d be on his playlist
my phrases amazes the faces in places
the favourite, huh
my cup over runneth with hundreds
dummy, dammit, not like for me to waste it
the new commandment, thou shall not hate kid
My movement is like the civil rights I’m Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas baby those are marks
I met this girl on Valentines day fucked her in May
she found out about April so she chose to March
damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the two’s nigga, Noah’s Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my dro the mark
plus a trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinert
G-A-T in the pathfinder
cause you haters got PHD’s
y’all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods don’t make me grab iron

[RZA:]
A yo champagne wishes and dirty white bitches

cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
you know that shit is FUCKING ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
you know the shit is fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous
fucking ridiculous

[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don’t really care
two hands in the air if you don’t really care
it’s like that sometimes I mean ridiculous
it’s like that sometimes the shit’s ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don’t really care
middle finger in the air if you don’t really care
it’s like that sometimes, man ridiculous
life can be sometimes ridiculous
