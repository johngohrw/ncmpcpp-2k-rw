The force of your gravity
It defines my tendency
Velocity’s equal to
Throwing myself with you
We have potential energy
Motion between you and me
I’ll be your sounding board
Just throw yourself toward
This energy that sings between
Bounce off of me
Elasticity
Elastic
Kinetic
Electric
Connection
Collision
Rebounding (x…)
Enter me
Transfer energy
Enter me
