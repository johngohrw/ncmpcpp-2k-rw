(Rosetta..

Sweet Loretta Fart thought she was a cleaner
but she was a frying pan, yeah

Rosetta...

The picker! The picker! Picture the fingers burning!

Oo-wee!

OK?

1,2, 1,2,3,4)

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jojo
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Jo

Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back Loretta
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

Get back
Woo...

(Thanks, Mo!

I'd like to say "thank you" on behalf of the group
and ourselves and I hope we passed the audition!)
