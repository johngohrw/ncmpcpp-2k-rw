Annie knows when it's me
Knows how I'm feeling and gives me her healing
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

I'm going down, going down, going down, going down

Annie, daddy won't let me
Daddy won't let me go and that's why I feel so low
Oh Annie, sit down beside me
Let me confide in you, you know when I'm blue
You know when I'm lonely and, honey, I'm lonely

I'm going down, going down, going down, going down
