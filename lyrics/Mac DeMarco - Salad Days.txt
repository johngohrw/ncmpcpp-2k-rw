As I'm getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die

[scat singing]

Missing hippy Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long

[scat singing]

Oh mama, actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign

[scat singing]

Salad days are gone, missing hippy Jon
Remember the days just to tell ‘em so long

[scat singing]

Oh mama, actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year [x2]
