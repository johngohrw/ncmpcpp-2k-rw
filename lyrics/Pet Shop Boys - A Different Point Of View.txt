When I'm sitting so close to you
There's only one thing that I wanna do
But I know what you're likely to say
That I'm going about it the wrong way

We can't agree about anything
Where to go or even where we've been
And I know what you're likely to do
Say that I've never cared about you

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

You don't believe a single word I say
If I'd say black was white, you'd say it was grey
But in spite of being treated this way
I still dream of you all night and day

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

Just this once
Just say yes
Please

You've got a clever way of haunting me
I'm never scared, but you're still daunting me
'Cause I know what you're likely to say
And I know that you'll get your own way

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view
