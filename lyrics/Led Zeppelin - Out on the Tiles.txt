As I walk down the highway all I do is sing this song, 
And a train that's passin' my way helps the rhythm move along. 
There is no doubt about the words are clear, 
The voice is strong, is oh so strong. 

I'm just a simple guy, I live from day to day. 
A ray of sunshine melts my frown and blows my blues away, 
There's nothing more that I can say but on a day like today 
I pass the time away and walk a quiet mile with you. 

[Chorus]
All I need from you is all your love, 
All you got to give to me is all your love, 
All I need from you is all your love, 
All you got to give to me is all your love. 
Oooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, oh yeah. 

I'm so glad I'm living and gonna tell the world I am, 
I got me a fine woman and she says that I'm her man, 
One thing that I know for sure gonna give her all the loving 
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can. 

Standing in the noonday sun trying to flag a ride, 
People go and people come, see my rider right by my side, 
It's a total disgrace, they set the pace, it must be a race 
And the best thing I can do is run. 

[Chorus]
