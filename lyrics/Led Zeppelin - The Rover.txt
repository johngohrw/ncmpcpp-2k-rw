I've been to London, seen seven wonders. I know to trip is just to fall 
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it. I always knew what it was for. 

There can be no denyin' that the wind 'll shake 'em down 
And the flat world's flyin'. There's a new plague on the land 

If we could just join hands [X3]

Traversed the planet when heaven sent me. I saw the kings who rule them all 
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight. I hear the rested rivers call 
And the wind is crying, from a love that won't grow cold 
My lover, she is lying, on the dark side of the globe 

If we could just join hands [X3]

You got me rockin' when I ought to be a-rollin' 
Darlin', tell me, darlin', which way to go 
You keep me rockin', baby, then you keep me stolen 
Won't you tell me, darlin', which way to go... that's right 

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry and I would dearly like to know 
I've all this wonder of earthly plunder will it leave us anything to show 

And our time is flyin' see the candle burnin' low 
Is the new world rising, from the shambles of the old 

If we could just join hands.
