Gonna be like a dog 
Lay flat on my back 
Pull my feet off the ground 
Let my head hit the sack 

I'm muscle in plastic 
Nyjinski's bad move 
Just a white show piece 
I've got nothing to lose 

I preach for the praise 
Can't laugh so I gaze 
Like a bad offset 
I'm just counting the days 

I'm a muscle in plastic 
Nyjinski's bad move 
Just a white show piece 
I've got nothin, nothing to lose 

Sonar blips on my arms 
My head's increased 
Just a hotel inmate 
I'm the lover deceased 
I'm the latent impression of a dancer's leg 
I like faking persuasion 
And laying my bed 

I'm a muscle in plastic 
Nyjinski's bad move 
Just a white show piece 
I've got nothing to lose
