I got this thing
Gonna blow your mind
Pulling your string
Helping you unwind

You want to know
But it can’t be taught
You want to steal
'Cause I can’t be bought

I got this thing
Gonna tie your tongue
Step in my ring
You’ll be out round one

You want to feel
But you got no touch
You think it’s love
But you think too much

I got it
I got it
I got it

I got this thing
Gonna break you down
You’re crumbling
Till you hit the ground (ground, ground, ground, ground, ground)

You wanna try
Come and have your taste
This thing won’t stop
'Til you can’t see straight

I got it [repeat]
I got this thing
