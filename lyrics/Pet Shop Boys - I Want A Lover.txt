At this time of night, when the crowds have passed
We're the last to leave, we need some company
No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why
You know the reason that we need this company
I've been sitting here, looking out for you
Someone just like me, who's maybe had a drink or two

I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight
Tonight

Outside the dawn is breaking, looks like it's started raining
We'll catch a cab, and soon be driving home
No need to look so shy, don't even wonder why
You'll know the reason just as soon as we get home
You've been sitting there, wondering what to do
I've been standing here, waiting to make the first move
Ahaha

I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight (Tonight)
I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight
Tonight

This anticipation is a stimulation
No need for conversation as we're driving home
Put your arms around me, it doesn't mean you love me
Just that you want me and you need my company
Driving through the night, it's so exciting
Turning off the light without another thought tonight
Ahaha

I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight (I want a lover tonight)
I don't want another drink or fight
I want a lover
I don't care whether it's wrong or right
I want a lover tonight
Tonight

(I want you, I want your love) - I want a lover
(I want you, I want your love) - I want a lover
(I want you, I want your love) - I want a lover (I want your love tonight)
Oooh
