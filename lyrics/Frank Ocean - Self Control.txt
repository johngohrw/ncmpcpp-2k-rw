Pool side convo about your summer last night, oh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mmm
Could I make it shine last night
Could I make it shine, on it last night, last night
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rare, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blinded life
Wish I was there, wish we had grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never cause I made you use your self control
And you made me lose my self control, my self control

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
I, I, I
Know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I
Know you got someone comin'
You're spitting game, oh you got it
