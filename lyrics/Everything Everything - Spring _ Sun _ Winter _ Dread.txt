Their hands loom heavy with only an hour to go
I hold my breath but the seekers will find me
Priest and pauper, the leper can't change his spots
The King knows and I know it, and everybody knows

[Chorus x2:]
Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread
I don't want to get older
(No way, no way)

Are those my people or are they barbarians all?
I need a shoulder to talk to about it
Swing the hammer
The fragments (the fragments)
A skull exploding on you, on all you
And showers on the infant's bed

[Chorus x4:]
Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread
I don't want to get older
(No way, no way)

You are a thief and a murderer too
Stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again

I know that you are a thief and a murderer too
You stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again

I saw that you are a thief and a murderer too
You stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again

[x3:]
I know that you are a thief and a murderer too
You stole the face that you wear from a craven baboon
Cause you did it to her, and you did it to him
And you did it before and you'll do it again
