You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before
I know

They sold you on their way
Oh, honey, that's OK

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap

And storefronts rarely changed
At least I'm on my own again
Instead of anywhere with you

But, to me, it's all the same

And I lost my page. Again
I know this is surreal
But, I'll try my luck with you
This life is on my side
Well, I am your one?
"Believe me, this is a chance," oh oh

Let's see what's for sale
He's trying hard to give his job a chance
Oh, it's never gonna be
It's sad, but I agree
The signals don't seem right
They last for just one night, and then
I'm sorry that I said:
"That we were just good friends"

No harm, he's armed
Setting off all your alarms
They're trapped
I can't be there in time
I'll think about that

And I lost my page again
I know this is surreal
But, I'll try my luck with you
This life is on my side
Well, I am your one?
"Believe me, this is a chance," oh oh
