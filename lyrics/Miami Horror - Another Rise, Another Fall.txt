Oh we keep trying
To spend a little time on our own
Oh we can't hide it
We're sitting in a lavender grove

Another rise, another fall
Another chance to lose it all
Another high, another dawn
Another story to call my own

If you wanna sing in harmony
It doesn't matter to me
If you wanna go, I'll make you know
In a symphony

Oh we keep trying
To spend a little time on our own
Oh we can't hide it
We're sitting in a lavender grove

All these nights away

If you wanna sing in harmony
It doesn't matter to me
If you wanna go, I'll make you know
In a symphony

If you wanna sing in harmony
If you wanna go, I'll make you know
It's just a change of me
It's just a change of scene

Say it's not that safe
I'll change, I'll change, I'll change
I'll change, I'll change, I'll change

Another rise, another fall
Another chance to lose it all
Another high, another dawn
Another story to call my own

Oh we keep trying
To spend a little time on our own
Oh we can't hide it
We're sitting in a lavender grove
