C-O-double M-O-N, a wave, an awesome wave
That rushes skin and widens in flooded veins
Breath in, exhale, I've poked a nerve
He'll slap me like a whale

Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N
Tide out, tide in, a flood of blood
To the heart through the fear slipstreams
Breath in, exhale, I've poked a nerve
You'll slap me like a whale

Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N
Flood of blood to the heart
