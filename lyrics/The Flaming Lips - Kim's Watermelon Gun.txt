Well Kim's got the answer with her watermelon gun
And all the celebrities want permission,
But she won't give it to them, til they learn how to love...
And Kim's got her watermelon gun, cause its the consciousness of love

And wouldn't it be dumb if all their atrocities were just forgiven
But she won't give that to them, until they learn how to love.
And Kim's got her watermelon gun, cause its the consciousness of love.
She won't give it to them, she won't give it to them...
