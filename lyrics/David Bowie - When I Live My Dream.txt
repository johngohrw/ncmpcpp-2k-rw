When I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you

Happy at the sound of your voice

Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever

When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 

And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 

Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me

Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave 
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dream
