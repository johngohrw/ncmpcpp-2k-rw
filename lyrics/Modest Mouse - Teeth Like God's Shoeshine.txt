From the top of the ocean - Yeah
From the bottom of the sky -Goddamn
Well I get claustrophobic
I can you know that I can
And he said:
"I am not allowed much danger
keep in line you're an old friend stranger.
you'll burn me if effigy and I'll burn you in effigy."
A rattle snake up in buffalo Montana
he bit the leg of the old sheriff
Ha! That boy fell down on his harelip -Ow! Ow!
Well I might be wrong
but you you tag along
and we we all been wronged
and I get dizzier by the mile
Said hell! The money's spent
went to the county line
and paid the rent said "Uh-oh."
Oh! If you could compact your conscience
Oh! And you might.
Oh! If you could bottle and sell it you might have done
Oh! And you might
Oh! If you could compact your conscience
and sell it save it for another time
you might have to use it.
And the televisions gone
Go to the grocery store, buy some new friends
and find out the beginning, the end, and the best of it
Well, do you need a lot of what you've got to survive?
Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles shimmers shines
let's all have another Orange Julius
This syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon to be ghost towns
so long, farewell, good-bye
Take 'em all for the long ride
and you'll go around town
no one wants to be uptight anymore
You can be ashamed
or be so proud of what you've done
but not no one, not now, not ever or anyone
take 'em all for the sense of happiness
that comes from hurting deep down inside
Or you can walk th line and give a shit
I'm on the corner of this and this and this and this
and its all all wrong, and its all all gone
Well, you can add it up and give a shit
go to the family doctor
Its all worth it
and its all all gone, and its all all wrong
Here's the man with teeth like God's shoeshine
He sparkles shimmers shines
let's all have another Orange Julius
Thick syrup standing in lines
The malls are the soon to be ghost towns
so long, farewell, good-bye
And the telephone goes off
pick to receiver up, try to meet ends
and find out the beginning, the end and the best of it
