My Sentimental MelodyThe Magnetic FieldsI'm a hopeless romanticYou're a terrible flirt Cool and unfazedYou're always amazed When someone gets hurt I live on the blue planet That I saw in your eyes But now I can't stay Knowing it's made Of beautiful lies But my sentimental melody Like a long-lost lullabye Will ring in your ears Down through the years Bringing a tear to your eye Goodbye Love can kill people, can't it Well it still might kill me Each drop of rain Is a glass of champagne It's sweet and it's free When I drink I don't panic When I drink I don't die When I'm far gone It's all just a song Just beautiful lies...But my sentimental melody Like a long-lost lullabye Will ring in your ears Down through the years Bringing a tear to your eye Goodbye[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:My_Sentimental_Melody ]
