Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates....
Woah!

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it but that's how you made it
Just keep it oblique
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all suh-suh-suh sucked-in-by parlour tricks

Oh the people deceive you the kids never leave
Cuz you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still you pick up the phone
But hey man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old
Ah ooh! we do what we're programmed to do--
Hey we do what we're told

I never remember to carry my book when I get on the bus
You never forget it's your time to collect
When they are making a fuss
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all high high high, high high on wiggling hips
Ah ooh! you break off your plans for the weekend
And ah oh! you can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all the plans cuz we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We all claw claw claw, cli-climb-on to sinking ships
And ah ooh! avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah ooh! celebrate! celebrate! celebrate!
And then turn to stone

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes
C'mon

Hey the rock writer told me to tell you:
"though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star."
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes
Ow!
