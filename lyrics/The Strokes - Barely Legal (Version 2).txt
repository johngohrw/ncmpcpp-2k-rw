I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck

I wanna steal your innocence
To me, my life, it don't make sense
Those strange manners, I loved 'em so
"Why won't you wear your new trench coat?"

I should've worked much harder
I should've just not bothered
I never show up on weekdays
Something that you learned yesterday

"Drive you to work; you'll be on time
These little problems they're not yours and mine,"
"Come on and listen to what I say
I've got some secrets that'll make you stay"

I just want to turn you down
I just want to turn you around
Oh, you ain't never had nothin' I wanted, but...
I want it all
I just can't figure out...
Nothing

And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, you're a freak"
"They ordered me to make mistakes"
Together again, like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
For the record it's between you and I

Oh, I didn't take no shortcuts
I spent the money that I saved up
Oh, Momma running out of luck
Like my sister, don't give a fuck

I wanna steal your innocence
To me my life, it just don't make any sense
Those strange manners, I loved 'em so
"Why won't you wear your new trench coat?"

I just want to misbehave
I just want to be your slave
Oh, you ain't never had nothing I wanted, but...
I want it all
I just can't figure out...
Nothin'

And all together it went well
We made pretend we were best friends
Then she said, "Oh, I can wait"
They ordered me to make mistakes
Together again like the beginning
It all works somehow in the end
The things we did, the things you hide
And for the record, it's between you and I
