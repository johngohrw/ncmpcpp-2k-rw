Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, in the whole city
This shit ain't gonna stop
It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets any better

Momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than 'em telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace, but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)

All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'm a start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose a bet, we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5 for it
Keychain go jangalang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
(Nine, nine, yeah, not six)
