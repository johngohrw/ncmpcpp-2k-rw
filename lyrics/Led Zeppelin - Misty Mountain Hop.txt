Walkin' in the park just the other day, Baby, 
What do you, what do you think I saw? 
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said, 
"Hey, Boy, do you wanna score?" 
And you know how it is; 
I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh, 
So I asked them if I could stay awhile. 

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really, 
Really out of my mind. 
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said, 
"Please, hey, would we care to all get in line, 
Get in line." 
Well you know, They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun, 
Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh. 

Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see, 
And Baby, Baby, Baby, do you like it? 
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin' 
Ah, not trying to fight it. 
You really don't care if they're coming, oh, oh, 
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh. 

If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better, 
You better open your eyes. 
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't 
Which, which way the pressure lies, 
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now. 
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains 
Where the spirits go now, 
Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh. 
I really don't know.
