Daddy was a Cajun, raised on Southern land 
And so my kinfolks tell me, was a street-fightin' man. 
Well, they rushed him down to see the doctor 
"Hey doctor, won't you check his head?" 
The only thing that was wrong with him 
Was Johnny Walker's Red 
He drank ole poison whiskey 
'Til it killed him dead.

It happened back in the bayou many years ago 
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow 
Well, they rushed him back to see the doctor 
The doctor just shook his head, 
"Twenty years of rotgut whiskey 
Done killed the poor man dead." 
He drank ole poison whiskey 
'Til it killed him dead.

Take a tip from me, people... brothers can't you see 
Ain't no future in ole poison whiskey. 
They're gonna rush you down to see the doctor, 
The doctor's gonna shake his head. 
The only thing he's gonna tell ya 
"Stop drinkin' Johnny Walker's Red 
Don't drink poison whiskey, don't you drink it boy.
