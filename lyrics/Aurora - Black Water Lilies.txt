I'm on a boat
I float - I know I can never drown
I see underwater now
The wind is the only sound...

Take your hand when I go under
I'm over and above
Take your hand when I go under
I'm over and above

[x2]
On the river
I'm floating in;
Underwater
I'm diving into the ocean
A thousand black water lilies...

Black water lilies...

Arms are reaching forwards
My arms - I can see no more
We dance as we float around
We head towards the ocean floor

Take your hand when I go under
I'm over and above
Take your hand when I go under
I'm over and above

[x2]
On the river
I'm floating in;
Underwater
I'm diving into the ocean
A thousand black water lilies...

I am floating down
I can recall
