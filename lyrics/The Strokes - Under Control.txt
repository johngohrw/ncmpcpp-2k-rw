I don't want to waste your time,
I don't want to waste your time.
I just want to say -
I've got to say,
We worked hard, darling
We don't have no control
We're under control

I don't want to do it your way,
I don't want to do it your way.
I don't want to give it to you, your way.
I don't want to know...

I don't want to change your mind,
I don't want to change the world.
I just want to watch it go by.
I just want to watch you go by.
We were young, darling
We don't have no control
We're out of control

I don't want to do it your way,
I don't want to do it your way.
I don't want to give it to you, your way.
I don't want to know...

I don't want to change your mind,
I don't want to waste your time.
I just want to know you're alright.
I've got to know you're alright;
You are young, darling
For now, but not for long
Under control.
