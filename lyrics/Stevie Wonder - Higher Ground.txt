People keep on learnin' 
Soldiers keep on warrin' 
World keep on turnin' 
Cause it won't be too long 

Powers keep on lyin' 
While your people keep on dyin' 
World keep on turnin' 
Cause it won't be too long 

I'm so darn glad he let me try it again 
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
Gonna keep on tryin' 
Till I reach my highest ground 

Teachers keep on teachin' 
Preachers keep on preachin' 
World keep on turnin' 
Cause it won't be too long 
Oh no 

Lovers keep on lovin' 
Believers keep on believin' 
Sleepers just stop sleepin' 
Cause it won't be too long 
Oh no 

I'm so glad that he let me try it again 
Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin 
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then 
Gonna keep on tryin' 
Till I reach my highest ground...Whew! 

Till I reach my highest ground 
No one's gonna bring me down 
Oh no 
Till I reach my highest ground 
Don't let nobody bring you down (they'll sho 'nuff try) 
God is gonna show you higher ground 
He's the only friend you have around
