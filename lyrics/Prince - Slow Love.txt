Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that U're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
4 he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make IT slow
Just like the wind blows

Let's make IT last forever
For a hundred times won't be enough
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feelin'
You've got me reelin'

U can see through race car drivers
Let me show U what I'm made of
Tonight is the night 4 making slow love

[repeated to fade]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time
