I bet she could never make you cry
'Cause the scars on your heart are still mine
Tell me that she couldn't get this deep
She can almost be the worst than me
Too bad she's just eating off your dreams
Let me know when you're ready to plea
Maybe you just need to send for me
Send for me, send for me
Send for me, send for me, send for me
