I fell over
I fell onto the ground
I wish I was sober
I can't get up off the ground

I closed my eyes
And thought I was blind
It's the middle of the night
And I'll never be alright again

And this wallpaper
Keeps going round the room
Keeps going round the room
And I follow it around the room

Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I still love you
But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

And I sat there on the steps
Considering death
There were only second left of the night

And I said hell is the sun
Burning forever at the center of things
A ball on fire at the center of things
A ball on fire at the center of things
A brain on fire at the center of things
A brain on fire at the center of things
