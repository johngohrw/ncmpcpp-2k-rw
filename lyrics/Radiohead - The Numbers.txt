It holds us like a phantom
The touch is like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling

Open on all channels
Ready to receive
And we're not at the mercy
Of your shimmerers or spells
Your shimmerers or spells
Mmmhm

We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else

(One day at a time)
One day at a time

We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
Your system is a lie
The river running dry
The wings of a butterfly
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours

One day at a time
