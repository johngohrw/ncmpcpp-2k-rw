This that rap god shit nigga
I rip every one of these motherfuckers down
Aye, rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah

Close eyes, see things
Fire up, tweaking
You're my freak dreams
You're my freak dreams
Bad bitch, you dig that
Get stacks, drive cars
Whip that, bitch out
Tits out, oh shit
My dick out, can she suck it right now?
Fuck, can she fuck right now?
I done asked twice now
Can you bring your price down?
Lil Boosie with the wipe down
A little woozy but a nice night
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now?
What the, what the fuck right now?
What if we fuck right now?
What if we fucked right in the middle
Of this motherfuckin' dinner table
What if we just fucked up this whole party
Would we be the life of the whole party?
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody stop buggin'?
Would everybody stop buggin'?
Would everybody stop buggin'? They don't want nothin'
You motherfuckers living like half of your level, half of your life
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto, I ain't gon' lie
We be in the bathroom fucking like baby don't get too loud
I can, I can sing it, yeah

[Hook:]
I need you right now
I need you right now, I need you right now
I need you right now
I need you right now, I need you right now
I need you right now
I need you right now, I need you right now
I need you right now

I miss the old Kanye, shit from the gold Kanye
Talking 'bout the soul Kanye, set all his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I'd like to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, there wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanye's
I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I miss the old Kanye"
Man that would be so Kanye, that's all it was Kanye
We still love Kanye and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
