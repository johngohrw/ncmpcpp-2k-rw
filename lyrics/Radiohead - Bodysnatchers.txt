I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong

Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no

I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out

Make a sound
Move back home
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off

I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves everywhere

Has the light gone out for you?
Cause the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
You can fight it like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in
All their eyes wrapped around my face
All their eyes wrapped around my face
Although everybody else can see
Although everybody else can see

I'm alive

I've seen it coming
