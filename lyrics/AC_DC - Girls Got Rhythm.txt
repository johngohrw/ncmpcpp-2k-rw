I been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she got
She stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me of my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walkin' down the street
Wearin' dresses so tight
And lookin' dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
The girls got rhythm

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She gives me first degree
She really satisfy me
Love me till I'm legless
Achin' and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the third world war
You know I'm losin' sleep
But I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it can't live without it
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
The girls got rhythm

You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it can't live without it
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
The girls got rhythm
You know she really got the rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (rock 'n' roll rhythm)
The girls got rhythm
