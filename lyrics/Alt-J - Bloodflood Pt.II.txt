Heat shimmer
Hips quiver
Open smother
Lipped lover

Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Razor blades on a melted toothbrush
Slash, slash / Assassin de la police

Heat shimmer
Silky glistener
Open smother
Lipped lover

Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Silent knife, unholy knife
I've fallen for the black outside my window

On the C-O-double-M-O-N
On the C-O-double-M-O-N

A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart

A flood of blood to the heart (Quelea, quelea)
