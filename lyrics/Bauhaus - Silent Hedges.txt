Following the silent hedges
Needing some other kind of madness
Looking into purple eyes
Sadness at the corners
Works of art with a minimum of steel

Pure sensation
The beautiful down grade
Going to hell again
Going to hell again

Self confidence leaks
From a thousand wounds
Faults of civilization
Burning the private paradise of dreams
Minus hands of the electric clock
Clock [x3]

What happens when the intoxication of success has evaporated?

Pure sensation
The beautiful down grade
Going to hell again
Going to hell again
Again [x3]
