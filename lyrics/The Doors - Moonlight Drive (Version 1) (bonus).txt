Let's swim to the moon, uh huh 
Let's climb through the tide 
Penetrate the evenin' that the 
City sleeps to hide 
Let's swim out tonight, love 
It's our turn to try 
Parked beside the ocean 
On our moonlight drive 

Let's swim to the moon, uh huh 
Let's climb through the tide 
Surrender to the waiting worlds 
That lap against our side 

Nothin' left open 
And no time to decide 
We've stepped into a river 
On our moonlight drive 

Let's swim to the moon 
Let's climb through the tide 
You reach your hand to hold me 
But I can't be your guide 

Easy, I love you 
As I watch you glide 
Falling through wet forests 
On our moonlight drive, baby 
Moonlight drive 

Come on, baby, gonna take a little ride 
Down, down by the ocean side 
Gonna get real close 
Get real tight 
Baby gonna drown tonight 
Goin' down, down, down
