Wait, wait for the moment to come
Stand up, stand up and take my hand
Believe, believe in mystery
Love love love love is simple as 1-2-3

I'm a know-it-all, I'm smartest man around
That's right, you learn real fast through the smartest girl in town
Here come a riddle, here come a clue
If you were really smart, you'd know what to do
When...

Jump back, sit back, get back, relax
It's ok
I've called in sick I won't go to
Work today
I'd rather be with the
One I love
I neglect my duties, I be in trouble but

I've been to college, I've been to school
I've met the people that you read about in books
Here come a riddle, here come a clue
If you were really smart you'd know what to do when I say
Jet pilot gone out of control, ship captain on the ground
Stock broker make a bad investment when love has come to town

Where, where is my common sense?
How...did I get in a jam like this?
Believe, I believe in mystery
Love, love love love is simple as 1-2-3

Here come a riddle, here come a clue
If you were really smart, you'd know what to do when I say
Why am I going out of my head, whenever you're around?
The answer is obvious, love has come to town
