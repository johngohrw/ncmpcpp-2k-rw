I don't know who my mother is
But I creep for you
(Creep, mothercreep, mothercreep)
Moments in change
I'm still chasing
I'll be home soon
(Creep, mothercreep, mothercreep)
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
(Creep, mother)
(Creep, mother)

Whisper in tongues
Hit me with your hands
Double knot my throat, mother
In words I lose
Don't be mad
Advocating every second, every minute
To my mind it's so sweet
And I wish you could see it
I'll be home soon

Creep, mothercreep, mothercreep, mothercreep
Creep, mothercreep, mothercreep, mothercreep, mothercreep
Creep, mothercreep...
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
Creep (mothercreep)
