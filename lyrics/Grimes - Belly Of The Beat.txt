I, I've been thinking
I've been thinking
I, I could feel The World Today
Everybody dies in the Point they arise and we dance like angels to
Breaking all you need in the shapes of faiths and knowledge of you

And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
In the Belly of the Beat Yeah!

I, I've been thinking
I've been thinking
I, I could leave the world today
Everybody dies, we cut out their eyes and we dance like angels do
Breaking our name in a world that feigns some knowledge of you

And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
In the Belly of the Beat Yeah!
