when i was younger
i used to wonder like

if i was singing songs
just to sing the songs
or if was singing cause
that's what the bitches wanted
i couldn't play guitar like van halen
had no secret chords like saint david
but you still came around
ate your lunch wit me
used to park your car
to try to bus with me
but i would say "girl dont be dumb"
i'm riding shotgun

we could go to my house after school
after school after school
cause my dad don't clock off till late
off till late off till late
we could kick it in the living room
looking through my whole vinyl collection
and you could teach me how to slow dance or something
and i can give you chills harmonizing to
otis, isley, marvin

and everytime somebody asked me
if i sing songs to get at women
i say yea
they say
no fair no fair that's cheating
i say shit o well o well
and everytime a nigga asks me
if i sing songs to get at women
i say yea
they say
no fair no no fair that's cheating
i say boah don't judge cause hell
if you were me

you'd be singing to her
like la da da da da
la da da da da
la da da da da

now i'm in the lab
always working late
always sleeping past
the break fast she makes
she used to stopby
come and holla at me
put her purse down
and try to battle rap me
she don't do that no more
no more no more
don't even listen to the songs i record
but she be banging that drake in my car
i'm so far gone
she stay blasting trey and his songs
all damn day long
it's like she never heard of me
heard of me

now everytime somebody asks me
if i sing songs to get at women
i say naw they say okay i don't believe it
i say nope i swear i never do it
and everytime a nigga asks me
if i sing songs to get at women
i say naw they say
who do you think you're kidding
i know you, you stole my girlfriend

now see i just don't play fair
but it's fair enough
cause yo girl broke my heart
in half
now i'm singing la da ad da ah ah
bout heartbreak oh
and now im'm singing la da da da da ah ah ah
bout love lost ohhh
