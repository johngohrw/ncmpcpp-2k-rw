You know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defenses say I did't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar

Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares
'Cause just what I've been through is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy -- this is only a guess

Do you know what it's like to hate when it's way down deep inside?
Oh, God, I hate what's been done to my life
I could rule the pain, I could rule the night
Or would I ruin my salvation?
Ruin my mind, rules your pains, rulers of the night
Ruin your salvation, ruin your mind

You know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defences say I didn't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar

Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares
'Cause just what I've been through is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy -- this is only a guess
