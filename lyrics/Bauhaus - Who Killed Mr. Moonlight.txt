Consider green lakes 
And the idiocy of clocks 
Someone shot nostalgia in the back 
Someone shot our innocence 
And all our colors have run

A broken arrow in a bloody pool 
The wound in the face 
Of midnight proposals 
Someone shot nostalgia in the back 
Someone shot our innocence 

In the shadow of his smile 
In the shadow of his smile 
In the shadow of his smile 
In the shadow of his smile 

All our dreams have melted down 
We are hiding in the bushes 
From dead men 
Doing Douglas Fairbanks' stunts 

All our stories burnt 
Our films lost in the rushes 
We can't paint any pictures 
As the moon had all our brushes 

Extracting wasps from stings in flight 
Who killed Mr. Moonlight?
Extracting wasps from stings in flight 
Who killed Mr. Moonlight?
Extracting wasps from stings in flight 
Who killed Mr. Moonlight?
In the shadow of his smile
In the shadow of his smile
Who killed Mr. Moonlight?
