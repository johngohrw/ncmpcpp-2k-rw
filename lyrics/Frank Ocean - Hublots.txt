Turn the mountain view, find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
Run

I know you're in there somewhere
Can't wait some, something you
Someone out there
Trying to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Late at night sometimes it helps
You don't have to be all by yourself
In the morning light
This'll all be over with
I know you're in there somewhere
Can't outrun something you need
It's been so long

Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Like 10, 10, 12, 11, 10, 6, aight? Platinum
