Angel, baby, there is nothing I'd rather do
Than love you all over, I will never do
Everything I love becomes everything I do

So, tell me anything, anything you want
You're my darling girl, tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything, anything you feel like
Anything you feel like

Je comprends
Je l'ai dit
C'est la vie
Oh Montréal, pull apart
Running every red light, you were right
Oh Montréal don’t break my heart
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Angel, baby, you got me feeling kinda blue
Think I need you and you know the things I would do
Everything I love is consolation after you

So, tell me anything, anything you like
You're my darling girl, tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything, anything you feel like
Anything you feel like

Je comprends
Je l'ai dit
C'est la vie
Oh Montréal, pull apart
Running every red light, you were right
Oh Montréal don’t break my heart
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I don’t need your medicine
Gonna dance all night
I’m high on adrenaline
That's right, that's right, that's right
I don’t need your medicine
Gonna dance all night
I’m high on adrenaline
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right
