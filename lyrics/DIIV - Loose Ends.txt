All our loose ends
Are gathered here inside this house
You left me here to sort them out

But its not all yours really
I kept a few to hold onto
I tied them to my wrists and you said:

"does it feel watered down?"
"does it feel over now?"

"do you feel watered down?"
"do you feel older now?"

You hated when I said
I needed anything, I didn't
So I walked into your room
And took it all
