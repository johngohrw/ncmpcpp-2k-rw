Ooooh you cannot reach me now 
Ooooh no matter how you try 
Goodbye cruel world it's over 
Walk on by 
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall 
Waiting for the worms to come 
In perfect isolation here behind my wall 
Waiting for the worms to come 
Waiting to cut out the deadwood 
Waiting to clean up the city 
Waiting to follow the worms 
Waiting to put on a black shirt 
Waiting to weed out the weaklings 
Waiting to smash in their windows 
And kick in their doors 
Waiting for the final solution 
To strengthen the strain 
Waiting to follow the worms 
Waiting to turn on the showers v And fire the ovens 
Waiting for the queers and the coons 
And the reds and the Jews 
Waiting to follow the worms 
Would you like to see Britannia 
Rule again my friend 
All you have to do is follow the worms 
Would you like to send our coloured cousins 
Home again my friend 
All you need to do is follow the worms.
