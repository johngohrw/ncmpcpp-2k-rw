Uh

My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D My mentor
Now let the story begin

Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Coping iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out
Yell out
You know the name dude
I gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime
Let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib

Big brother was Bigs Brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out
I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that BluePrint 1
Any beats in my pocket was that Blueprint form
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by the Black album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.Bs and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
Kept little brother at bay, at a distance
Put everything I felt was more focused
Only made me more focused
Only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the todum
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrodum

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.Ds friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the presidito
Hola ovito
The game getting foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1 I'm a beat my brother
On that diamond remix I swore I spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivery, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammies I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go
I guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna minggle yo.
Ya know
I told Jay I did a song with cold play
Next thing I know he got a song with coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate espanol
No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man should of told you first
But I told somebody else that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Bigs brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could smell um
A ideal in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city,Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.Ds friend
No I.D my mentor
And that's where the story ends

Don't kill this shit.....
