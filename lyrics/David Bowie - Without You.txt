Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life 
are gone
I look into my eyes

There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What could I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand

There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I do
