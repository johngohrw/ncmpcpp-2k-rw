May this song reach your heart
May your ears love the sweet melody
Every note, every chord
I've arranged them for you and for me

May the sound of my voice be your guide
Bring you closer to me
Let us bathe in the noise
Let the love in your heart speak to me

For now, I'll pretend
I'm holding your hand

May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song journey on to you

We met alone forbidden in the city
Running fast through time like Tubman and John Henry
But the time was wrong
Illegal aliens moaned
It's such a pity that the city's just a danger zone
Atomic blues bombing hearts like Iraqis in Babylon
The droid control will take your soul and rate it
Berate, slay it
You hate it and debate it but you don't get caught
And outlaw outrunning the law, ha

May the strings make you smile
May they always remind you of me

For now let's pretend
I'm holding your hand

May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song journey on for you
