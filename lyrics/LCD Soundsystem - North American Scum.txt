Oh oh oh
Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are north americans
And for those of you who still think we're from england
We're not, no.
We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die,
Far from North America,
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes.
Aha, oh, oh.
I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
Cause we're north americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it ok
Makes it go away.

Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're north american
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on north americans

We are north american scum
We're from north america

And all the kids all the kids that want to make the scene
Here in north america
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love where's the love where's the love where's the love where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man there's no love and the kids are uptight
So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go north americans
Oh you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in north america
But then I said the more I do it the better it gets

Let's rock north america

We are north american scum
We're from north america
We are north american scum
We are north american

New york's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo north america
And it's the furthest you can live from the government un huh huh
Some proud american christians might disagree
Here in north america
But new york's the only place we're keepin them off the street
Boo boo now we can't have parties like in spain where they go all night
Shut down in north america
Or like berlin where they go another night, alright, un huh un huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, north america.
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'cause we're north americans.

We are north american scum
We are north americans
We are north american scum
We love north america

Take me back to the states man
North american scum
Where we can be all we want if we really ??
North american
Where the dj gigs are as fun
Here in north american scum
Don't blame the canadians
Let go north america
