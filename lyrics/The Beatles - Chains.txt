Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, cos I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah

I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these...

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Oh, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me

Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these...

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah

Chains, chains of love...
