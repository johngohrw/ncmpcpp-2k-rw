Used to be my pleasure
When I'd wake up in the morning
Just to open my eyes and see you
Just to find you were lying there
But mornings now they seem to be an everyday affair
I'm just a picture in the memory of your mind

All I ever wanted
Every dream that I've ever cherished
Was to share in a kind of magic
That only lovers ever share
All you ever offered me
Was the moment then and there
I'm just a picture in your mind

I used to want you, oh how badly did I want you
I could not stand the hunger
I used to stay awake at night and think of nothing but you
And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me
It made me so damn happy
I couldn't satisfy my craziness for you

Now the spell is broken
And my dreams they've all turned to ashes
But I still have a love for living
By loving you I've only just begun
Love is never easy when it's given just by one
I'm just a picture in your mind

I used to want you, oh how badly did I want you
I could not stand the hunger
I used to lie awake at night and think of nothing but you
And when I would awake to find you lying there beside me
It made me so damn happy, babe
I couldn't satisfy my craziness for you

Found a few more answers
And I'm ready for tomorrow
But I still have to stop and wonder
If I've learned anything from what we've done
Love is never easy when it's given just by one
I'm just a picture in your mind
Picture in your mind
