"Come up and be a kite"

Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o.
My feet are heavy and I'm rooted in my wellios.
And I want to get away and go
From all these mirror windows.

I look at eye level, it isn't good enough.
And then I find it out when I take a good look up.
There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball
Calling me:

"Come up and be a kite,
On a diamond flight!
A diamond kite, a diamond kite.
Ooh, what a diamond!

"A diamond kite
On a diamond flight.
Over the lights, under the moon.
Over the lights, under the moon.
Over the moon, over the moon!"

I feel a rush along my body, like a bullet.
I'm 2-D after a push-and-pull feeling.
And I want to get back to safe home:
I love the homeland dome.*

I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind.
Well, I'm not sure if I want to be up here, at all.
And I'd like to be back on the ground,
But I don't know how to get down--down--down!

"Come up and be a kite,
On a diamond flight!
A diamond kite, a diamond kite.
Ooh, what a diamond!

"A diamond kite
On a diamond flight.
Over the lights, under the moon.
Over the lights, under the moon.
Over the moon, over the moon!"
