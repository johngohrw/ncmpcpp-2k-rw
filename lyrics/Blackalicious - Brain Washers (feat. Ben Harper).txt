Tryin' man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin' yes, I'm strivin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Walk to a time when minds was one
Came into creation as itself, mankind was born
Step into the eye of the storm, survive as pawn
Casualties of evil men, slidin' the blinders on

Lies will spawn, hey, are you conscious what side you're on?
Is the total story told or is it they hide you from?
Why are we, on the brink of murderin' more innocent?
Now we slide, we're patriotic and so militant

Get ya ride on, rise on, take a look
They done even takin' righteous laws, rewrote the books
To benefit the prize they got they eyes on
Minds run rampant, to be revealed when the proper time comes
Brain washers

Tryin' man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin' yes, I'm strivin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Brain washers, it's when you think how they wanna think
Speak, how they wanna speak, livin' in defeat
When you don't wanna question what they teach, as the truth
With no proof, with the fear of burnin' in eternal heat

When your programmed not to be your own man, but a sheep
Bein' heard as they word it, so you think it ain't free
When you sleep in a deep sleep, standin' on your feet
When your beat makin' ends meat, raw, thin and they see

Now your labeled obsolete, workin' for relief [Incomprehensible]
In the heat on bare feet, smile, showin' off your teeth
Good grief, it's a [Incomprehensible] how they work it
And they jerk it, while they surf, plus the surf keeps
The [Incomprehensible] underneath the brain washers

Tryin' man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin' yes, I'm strivin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Tryin' man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin' yes, I'm strivin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Tryin' man, I'm tryin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin' yes, I'm strivin', lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

{You just keep playin', can you bring that level up in my earphones?
And you bring their level up in my chairs, 'cause I'm playin' with sticks
And I'm drownin' 'em out, so if you can give them more of this
Yeah, you can bring that in even more, bring up}

{Yeah, you guys play
Yeah, that's perfect
Sounds of science
Kool-Aid, Chemistry, Arrow}
