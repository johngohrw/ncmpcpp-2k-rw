In another life
I woke up dreaming with a sigh
As the morning light
Was painting whispers of a joy

And I was in the candlelit bedroom
Enchanting beauty shimmering magically
Like an irridescent cloud
Being blown by a westerly wind

She can move your soul without you knowing
She can take your breath away from heaven

And I was captured by her loneliness
A wounded tiger on a willowy path
Like an opalescent moon all alone
In the sky of a foreign land

She can take your breath away from heaven
She can move your soul without you knowing
She can take your breath away from heaven
She is like an everlasting blossom
She can take your breath away from heaven
