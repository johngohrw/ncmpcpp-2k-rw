It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
I, first time I done saw you
You text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
I, it's highlights when I was convinced
That it isn't much more it's so not you
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga

He told me

I used to fuck with all of 'em

Yeah I ain't got bitches no more

But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga, that shit Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to even feel about it
