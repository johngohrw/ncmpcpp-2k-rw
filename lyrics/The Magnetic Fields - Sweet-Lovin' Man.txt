Sweet-Lovin' ManThe Magnetic FieldsThere's an hour of sunshine for a million years of rain But somehow that always seems to be enoughWhen love falls from the sky nobody ever asks whyYou just take it or you leave it where it wasBut there's just one kind of love you can spend your life dreaming ofFor the love of a sweet-lovin' manSome have traveled far and wideSome have given up and diedFor the love of a sweet-lovin' manSome have broken down and criedSome have turned to dust insideBut I'll stay right here and hide In the arms of my sweet-lovin' manUntil you've had sweet lovin' there's no lovin' worth the nameBut you can go blind from crying all the timeAnd who said life was easy and who said a man was fair?Well I wish you well but keep your paws off mineYou can't buy one at the mall but he'll come if you just call...[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Sweet-Lovin%27_Man ]
