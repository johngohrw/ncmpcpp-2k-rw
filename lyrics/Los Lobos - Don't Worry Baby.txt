Standin' there by the window
Starin' out at the night
You've got so many troubles
On your nervous mind
But don't worry baby
It's gonna work out fine

You hear the sound of footsteps
Stealing 'cross the floor
You picked up the receiver
You didn't know what for
Then you saw the shadow
Steppin' through the door

Well don't worry baby
What the world may bring
Well don't worry baby
It won't change a thing
Life is a fly
And then you die

Standin' near by the window
Starin' out at the night
You see your lover leanin'
Against the old street light
But don't worry baby
It's gonna be alright

He was tossin' and turnin'
And he couldn't sleep
It ain't sure to bother
And it was just a dream
So where was he goin'
Headin' down the street

Well don't worry baby
What the world may bring
Well don't worry baby
It won't change a thing
Life is a fly
And then you die
