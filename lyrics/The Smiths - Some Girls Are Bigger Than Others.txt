From the ice-age to the dole-age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls mothers are bigger than other girls mothers

As Antony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale
Oh I say

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls mothers are bigger than other girls mothers

"Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on"

"Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on" 

And I'll send you mine
