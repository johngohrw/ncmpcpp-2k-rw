How could I describe
This fading dream?
You turned and looked a way
It goes around getting louder now
Believe it
Freezes love that way

Name the song and I’ll
Just scream it
There’s a
Dead moon in my head
It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeting
To crash into again

How could I describe
A long lost dream?
You turned and looked a way
I’ve lived ten lives and had ten loves
To remind me
What I’ve been guilty of

Say the song and I’ll
Just scream
It there’s a
Fucked moon in my head
It claws the ground both lost and found
And fleeing
From the healthy moon
