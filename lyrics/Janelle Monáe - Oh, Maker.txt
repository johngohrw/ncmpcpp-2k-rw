I hear the drizzle of the rain
It's falling from my window
And in the corners of my mind
I hope that I'll get to see you again
La da die da die da die da die my friend

I hear the colors in the flowers
Just like the candle snuffed at dawn
You're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone
La da die da die da die da die

Suffering in sinking sand
All the hurt
See I'm really lost baby
We suffered a rare, rare blue
So much hurt
On this earth
But you loved me
And I really dared to love you too
Perhaps what I mean to say is
Is that it's amazing that your love was mine

Oh, Maker tell me did you know
This love would burn so yellow
Becoming orange and in it's time
Explode from grey to black then bloody white
La da die da die da die da die

Oh, Maker have you ever loved?
Or known just what it was?
I can't imagine the bitter end
Of all the beauty that we're living in
Oh no

Suffering in sinking sand
All the hurt
See I'm pretty lost baby
We suffered a rare, rare blue
So much hurt
On this earth
But you loved me
And I really dared to love you too
Perhaps what I mean to say
Is that it's amazing that your love was mine

Lost inside a lonely world where lovers pay the price
Barely get the sound of music to love and go dance to
Now it's time for us to go and no one ever has to know
You're love's in my pocket and your eyes, eye's are in my
Eyes in my soul, no one will know it but me
