You workin' in bars ridin' in cars
Never gonna give it for free
Your apartment with a view on the finest avenue
Lookin' at your beat on the street
You're always pushin', shovin', satisfied with nothing
You bitch you must be gettin' old
So stop your life on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what do you do for money
Where do you get your kicks

You're lovin' on the take and you're always on the make
Squeezin' all the blood outta men
They're all standin' in a queue just to spend a night with you
It's business as usual again
You're always grabbin', stabbin' trying get it back in
But girl you must be gettin' slow
So stop your life on the road
All your diggin' for gold
You make me wonder
Yes I wonder
Yes I wonder
Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what do you do for money

What do you do for money honey
How do you get your kicks
What do you do for money honey
How do you get your licks

Honey, what do you do for money, I said
Honey, what do you do for money, oh yeah

Honey, what do you do for money
Honey, what you gotta do for money
Honey, what do you do for money
What do you gotta do
What do you gotta do
