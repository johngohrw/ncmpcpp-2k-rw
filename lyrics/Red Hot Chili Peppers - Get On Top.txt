Get on Top Get on Top

Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me

Go-rilla cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but I'm iller

I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top

[Chorus:]
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

Get up come sit up I light but she lit up

Grass Hopper Show Stopper
The life of a Wife Swapper
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper
You do but I wopper

Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws

[Chorus]

Get on Top Get on Top

Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me

Speed Baller Rhodes Scholar
Bottom Bitch And a Bottom Dollar
Come with me 'cause I'm a Free Faller
You hoot but I holler

I'll malinger on your block
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock on
Set you up to get on top

Get on Top
