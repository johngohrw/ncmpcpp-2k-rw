This could be the day that we push through,
It could be the day that all our dreams come true,
For me and you,
'Til we're at the end of just another day

Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess,
Like success,
Like those times you wake up mystified

Oh it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt so good, so close I do with you
Until the day this could be feeling
Do you realize that I could feel it.

Everything is changing,
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here

Well, am I getting closer?
Will I ever get there?
Does it even matter?
Do I really need it?
Wish that I'd remember
And I'm on the outcome

(This could be the day that we push through)
Did I really want it?
Does it really matter?
It was only yesterday...
(It could be the day that all our dreams come true)
Didn't even know you...
Now I'm gonna miss you
(Oh it feels so real in my sleep, never felt so good, so close I do)

Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your game
It's the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should want my love
But she'd just be excited.
