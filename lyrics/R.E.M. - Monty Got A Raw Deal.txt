Monty this seems strange to me.
The movies had that movie thing,
But nonsense has a welcome ring
And heroes don't come easily.
Now, nonsense isn't new to me.
I know my head, I know my feet,
But mischief knocked me in the knees.
Said, Just let go. Just let go.

I saw the ocean meet the man.
I saw you buried in the sand.
A friend was there to hold your hand,
Said, Walk on by.
So, I went walking through the street.
I saw you strung up in a tree.
A woman knelt there said to me,
Said, Hold your tongue, man. Hold your tongue. 

You don't owe me anything.
You don't want this sympathy. (waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath. (waste your breath)
For the silver screen.

That nonsense doesn't mean a thing,
They tried to bust you in a sting,
But virtue isn't everything
So, don't waste time.
Now, here's a rhyme that you can steal.
Put this on your reel to reel.
Mischief threw a rotten deal.
Monty's laying low.
He is laying low.
Just let go, just let go.

You don't owe me anything.
You don't want this sympathy. (waste your breath)
Don't you waste your breath. (waste your breath)
Monty this seems strange to me.
