Someone here's a lie, somewhere underneath, caught between the railing, mirroring the beat. I no longer feel and the years asleep. Show no sense of hope, staring honestly.

I wanna go south of the river, glacier slow in the heart of the winter. I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter.

And this we'll celebrate, this we'll celebrate. There and on the stage, this is a mistake. Damn me off too long. Down the earth and moon, damn the clawing kneeling, rustling into change. In a moment I was caught, calling by a storm. In the moment of a hot.

I wanna go south of the river, glacier slow in the heart of the winter. I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter.

I'm not in a glove called how.

Few became, few became as glory as along against the forest state and starting living in the new. Harrow since, harrow since the farthest reach underneath inside a cheat. Something is alive, somewhere underneath. Caught between the real and the fake. I don't want to fit, there and has been found. Silence is so cold, and there's no sense at all. And I was someone else, I was something good. Barely in the old. There among the cold.

I wanna go south of the river, glacier slow in the heart of the winter. I wanna go south of the river, facing alone in the heart of the winter.
