I've seen you a couple of times
Guess I've seen you three times
Walking circles around me
When you stand in front of my eyes
I'll make sure I'll look
I'll make sure I'll look
I'll make sure I'll look
Away
Away, away
Away
She's like a little Chinese
She is Chinese
Maybe it would be nicer if I search out
The names
She comes around you and me
And when you stand in front of my eyes
I will look
I will look
I will look
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
She looks in distress
She looks impressive
When she is dancing her little home dance on me
Roll, roll, roll away, away, away, away
