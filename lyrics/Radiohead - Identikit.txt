Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all can love

When I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

Broken hearts make it rain

Pieces of the wreck of mankind
That you can't create
That we can create
That we can create

But now I see you messing me around
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know.
