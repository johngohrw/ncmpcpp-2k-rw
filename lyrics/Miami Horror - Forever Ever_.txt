Suddenly under water
When all I want is the sky
As the seasons go round round round
I got sun in my eyes

Suddenly under water
When all I want is the sky
As the seasons go round round round
I got sun in my eyes

I got sun in my eyes

On the streets to nowhere
It's just a matter of time
Before all the young just watch and think it

Could never get so high

You don't know what it's like
Too young to take flight
Too hard to realize
Well, you said forever
It all comes in time
She wasn't lonely
The stars in her eyes will shine
Will shine

Well, you said forever
It all comes in time
She wasn't lonely
The stars in her eyes will shine
Will shine

Cause everything is forever
Everything is forever

All I see is the water
All I want is the sky
Watch the time go down, down, down
I got sun in her eyes
