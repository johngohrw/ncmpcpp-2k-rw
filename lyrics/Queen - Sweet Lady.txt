You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
You bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone.

Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady...Stay sweet.

You say
"You call me up and feed me all the lines
"You call me sweet lime I'm some kind of cheese
"Waiting on the shelf
"You eat me up
"You hold me down
"I'm just a fool to make you a home

"And you say
"Sweet lady
"Sweet lady
"Sweet lady...Stay sweet."

My Sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet baby
Believe and we've got everything we need.
