Infidel can you hear
Would be strange delight
I need you to give your sympathy tonight
When you hear what I say
Deeds I've done
Realise I've never lost and never won

I've got a feeling that it's never right
There was a reason but it's out of sight
It's going down somewhere tonight
Under the gun

Put death in my hand
Learn to fight
Who could care if it's wrong or if it's right
We got no choice
Under command
We're ordered to die or take this land

Stupid bastards and religious freaks
So safe in their castle keeps
They turn away as a mother weeps
Under the gun

When brave men fall
Under crimson skies
There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's
eyes
Tears will dry
For those I kill
Remember no more their names but
someone will

The only way to be victorious
Screw the fools who think it's glorious
Who gives a toss about the likes of us
Under the gun
