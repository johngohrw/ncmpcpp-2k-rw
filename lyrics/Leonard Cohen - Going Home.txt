I love to speak with Leonard
He’s a sportsman and a shepherd
He’s a lazy bastard
Living in a suit
 
But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn’t welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse
 
He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he’s really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube
 
Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it’s better
Than before
 
Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without the costume
That I wore
 
He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living with defeat

A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn’t what I need him
To complete
 
I want him to be certain
That he doesn’t have a burden
That he doesn’t need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding
Which is to say what I have told him
To repeat
 
Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it’s better
Than before
 
Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without this costume
That I wore

Going home
Without the sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it’s better
Than before
 
Going home
Without the burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without this costume
That I wore
 
I love to speak with Leonard
He’s a sportsman and a shepherd
He’s a lazy bastard
Living in a suit
