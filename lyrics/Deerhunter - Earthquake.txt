Do you recall
Waking up on
A dirty couch
In the gray fog?
And the gray dog
Barking down the street?

Columns shake your feet
Beneath your feet
Beneath your feet
Beneath your feet

Do you recall?
Your face was white as all
Do you bone the sheets?
Do you think of me?
Your long lost friend from the sea

How long was heat?
How long was he?
How long was he?
How long was he?
How long was heat?
How long was he?
