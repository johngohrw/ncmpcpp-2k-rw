No [x42]
I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you.
(By the way) I was there and it wasn't like that.
You've come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding
Yeah
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round you stay frozen to the spot
You had the pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding yeah
Oh no no
