Once when our mother called
She had a voice of last year's cough 
We passed around the phone
Sharing a word about Oregon

When my turn came 
I was ashamed
When my turn came 
I was ashamed

Once when we moved away
She came to Romulus for a day 
Her Chevrolet broke down 
We prayed it never be fixed or be found 

We touched her hair 
We touched her hair 
We touched her hair 
We touched her hair 

When she had her last child
Once when she had some boyfriend somewhile 
She moved away quite far 
Our Grampa bought us a new VCR 

We watched it all night 
We grew up in spite of it 
We watched it all night 
We grew up in spite of it 

We saw her once last fall 
Our Grampa died in a hospital gown
She didn't seem to care 
She smoked in her room and coloured her hair 

I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her 
I was ashamed
I was ashamed of her
I was ashamed
I was ashamed
Of her
