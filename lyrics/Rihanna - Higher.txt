This whiskey got me Feelin pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry about the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

You take me higher
Higher than I've ever been babe
Just come over let's pour a drink babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late
Too late
You're like my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a jay
I wanna go back to the old ways
But I'm drunk instead with a full ash tray
With a little bit too much to say
