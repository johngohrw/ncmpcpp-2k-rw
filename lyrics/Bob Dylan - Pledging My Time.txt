Well, early in the morning
'Til late at night
I got a poison headache
But I feel all right
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too.

Well, the hobo got you high
He came to me natur'ly
After he stole my baby
Then he wanted to steal me
But I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too.

Won't you come with me baby ?
I'll take you where you wanna go
And if I don't work out
You'll be the first to know
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too.

Well, the room is so stuffy
I can hardly breathe
Ev'rybody's gone but me and you
And I can't be the last to leave
I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too.

Well, they sent for the ambulance
And one was sent
Somebody got lucky
But it was an accident
Now, I'm pledging my time to you
Hopin' you'll come through too.
