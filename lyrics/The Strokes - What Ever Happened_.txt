and I don't want to be reminded.
You say "please don't make this harder."

She wanna be admired.
You say "please don't make this harder."

Oh dear, is it really all true?
Did they offend us and they want it to sound new?

and I don't want to be reminded.
You say "please don't make this harder."
No, I won't yet.

I want to be beside her.
She wanna be admired.
You say "please don't make this harder."
No, I won't yet...
