[Kim]
Spinning dreams with angel wings
Torn blue jeans + a foolish grin
Burning down in the night
So cool + so right
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love
Close my eyes and think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me

Burning down in the night
Supercool it's alright
She knows how to make love to me
She knows how to make love
Close my mind when I think of you
Everything turns black to blue
Starpower starpower starpower
Over me
