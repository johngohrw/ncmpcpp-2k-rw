Are my lemons tied?
Is my hair in place?
Have I got a cute expression on my face?
Are my shoes all shined?
I try to keep in line
when I'm dancing in the show tonight

Does my shuffle step 
really look so good?
Am I doing it the way you think I should?
Would it be amiss
if I blew a kiss
when I'm dancing in the show tonight?

Showtime now is getting nearer
and I'm getting scared
wish I could see in the mirror
if I'm all prepared

First you take a step
then you point your toe
hope I know it like I did a week ago
Am I standing straight?
I can hardly wait
till I'm dancing in the show tonight
