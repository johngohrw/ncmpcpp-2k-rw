Seaside
Whenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile
I ask you to be my Clementine

You say you will if you could but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle
Highly commendable
Seaside Rendezvous

I feel so romantic. Can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (ooh I like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie Madames et Monsieurs
And at the peak of the season, the Mediterranean
This time of year it's so fashionable,

I feel like dancing in the rain,
Can I have a volunteer?
Just keep right on dancing
What a damn jolly good idea -

It's such a jollification as a matter of fact, so tres charmant, my dear

Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea reminiscing every night (shine on silvery moonlight)
Meantime (in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my Valentine

You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino

Get a new facial
Start a sensation

Seaside Rendezvous — so adorable,
Seaside Rendezvous — ooh hoo
Seaside Rendezvous — give us a kiss
