I know that I let you down
You're not keen on what you found
When's the funeral?
Do you want me to come?

I'm not what you're looking for
My house has an open door
You need a lock and key

I love all of your ideas
You love the idea of me

Lover, I've got no idea
Lover, I've got no idea
Lover, I've got no idea
