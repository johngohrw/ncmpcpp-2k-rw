You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me. I don't know what to tell you about him, I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me. No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there, with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to. I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life

Tell my baby I'm back in town
High lights
Tell everybody I'm back in town

Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine
We only making the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night Iâ€™m gon' wanna play shit back, I don't know
Sometimes I'm wishing that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slo-mo
Just shot a shot an amateur video I think I should, go pro
We only making the highlights
We only making the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to be mine

[Carole King:]

[Kanye West:]
I bet me and Ray J would be friends
If we ain't love the same bitch
Yeah, he might have hit it first
Only problem is I'm rich
Uh, 21 Grammys superstar family
We the new Jackson's and momma 'bout that action
I'm about that Farrakhan
Life is a marathon
I'ma shift the paradigm
I'm turn a baby down
I'ma bust a coach's head open on some Diddy shit
If he ever talk to my son like an idiot
One time for a nigga really getting it
Two times cause we got the whole city lit
Advice to all my niggas, impregnate Bridget
Soon as she have a baby she gon' make another nigga
Got the food in Islam and the trenches hah?
Even though they know Yeezus is a Christian hah?
She spent her whole check on some Christians
And that girl ain't even religious
Walking, living, breathing, girl you know my past well
Hard to believe in God your nigga got killed
Blac Chyna fuckin' Rob, help him with the weight
I wish my trainer would, tell me what I overate
So when I'm on vacay, I need to kick back
You want a boss or an R&B nigga with a six pack?
I need every bad bitch up in equinox
I need to know right know if you a freak or not
I need every bad bitch up in equinox
I need to know right know if you a freak or not
