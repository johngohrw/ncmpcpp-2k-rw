She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine your fever's gripped me again
Never kissesâ€”all you ever send are full stops, la, la, la

Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey, la, la, la
Break down, now weep,
Build up breakfast, now let's eat
My love, my love, love, love, la, la, la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut

Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey, la, la, la
Break down, now sleep
Build up breakfast, now let's eat
My love my love, love, love

She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love, la, la, la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut

She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germolene, disinfect the scene
My love, my love, love, love
But please don't go, I love you so, my lovely

Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart, hey

Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go
I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart

Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so, I love you so

I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so
I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so

I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
