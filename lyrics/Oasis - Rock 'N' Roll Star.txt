I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me 

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
When they said I should feed my head
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you're concerned about the way I feel 

Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star 

I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I've gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me 

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
When they said I should feed my head
Well, that to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
You're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you're concerned about the way I feel 

Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star 

You're not down with who I am
Look at you now, you're all in my hands
Tonight 

Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight, I'm a rock 'n' roll star 

It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
