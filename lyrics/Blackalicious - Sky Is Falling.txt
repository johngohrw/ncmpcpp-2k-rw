Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering membranes
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--

The sky is falling, life is appalling
And death is lurking, niggaz killing each other
Leaving bodies nobodies searching for
And youth announced ..., catching a bit of murder one
And mothers is drinking and drugging, hoe-in; searching for their son
And liquor stores upon every corner
And younger people done accepted defeating
The melting pot of lavas seeping
And the hood is all the mic can conceive when your foes bleeding to their death
And you picking their pocket
Wanna just get even
Niggers is banging and coppers is banging punk snuggin
Highly intelligent Africans lowered to punk smuggin
And capitals of the planet, planets run by the government
And genocide 's overwhelming, devil is loving it
And children in highschool go 'n smokin their classes up
And people thats rich don't be checking for what is happening
Degrading all women, knock em up, leave em, now smack em up
And ain't no way to reach us we're sleeping like hells castle
Sky is falling

Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering membranes
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--

Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering membranes
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--

Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering membranes
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--

The sky is falling, no one is watching
Tornadoes twisting wheres nobody is listening
And fires no one pays attention
Energies are erupting
Blurring the intentional vision
Doctors and lawyers and scientists all are locked in the prison of the mind
And all the youth are unreachable but they teachable
But emcees don't be teaching them too
Down deep down in their soul
Amongst the prostitution and pimping, robbing and stealing
We give a name
sab-a truth
This is nigger-land
Glad to knew ya
But give a damn
For the future
Religions is institutionalized
Hittin truths, even youths...alized
You got two pistols at the head of your own people
Its lethal but its living proof
Instead of leaving smiles leaven death inside of our living room
And instead of college they got us slangin after highschool
For the love of the money and everything that it will buy you
Everybody out for that
And they kill you if you a rival
20 lines and 1 stake on the table
Its about survival
The sky is falling

Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering membranes
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--

Revelation
