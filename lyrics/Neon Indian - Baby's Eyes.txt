Frankie, the forgotten son
Don't you know there's no running
From the things you've done?

Frankie
I swear I saw her load the gun
No use in shunning
When the deed's been done

Never coming home again
'till they see the world as I see you

When I'm looking into baby's eyes
And she just where I've been
I see the violence in her pretty eyes

Never coming home again
'till they see the world as I see you

Frankie
From the tabloid sun
The APB is out
Yeah, you're as good as done

Frankie
You shoulda' never gave her trust
Oh, your heart was ember
Now you're coughing dust

Never coming home again
'till they see the world as I see you

When I'm looking into baby's eyes
And she just where I've been
I see the violence in her pretty eyes

Never coming home again
'till they see the world as I see you
