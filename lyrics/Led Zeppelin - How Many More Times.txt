How Many More Times, treat me the way you wanna do? [x2]
When I give you all my love, please, please be true.

I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all. [x2]
I've got to get you together baby, I'm sure, sure you're gonna crawl.

[Spoken:]
I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinkin' it over, just what I had missed.
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then...
Whoops, oh Lord, well I did it again.
Now I've got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way that makes eleven.
But I'm in constant heaven.
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her 'cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give.

Oh, Rosie, oh, girl. Oh, Rosie, oh, yeah.
Steal away now, steal away.
Steal away, baby, steal away.
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play.
Why don't you come for me, baby, steal away, alright, alright.

Well they call me the hunter, that's my name.
Call me the hunter, that's how I got my fame.
Ain't no need to hide, Ain't no need to run.
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my... gun!

How Many More Times, barrelhouse all night long. [x2]
Well I've got to get to you, baby, oh, please come home.
Why don't you listen to me, babe.
Why don't you please come home? [x3]
