Tonight I could be with you 
Or waiting in the Wings 
Lift your heart with soaring song 
Cut down the puppet strings 
Cut down the puppet strings 

I wear a coat of drums 
And dance upon your eyes 
Turn the tables upside down 
Change the lows to highs 
Change the lows to highs 

I fill you up with butterflies 
Crown the heads of kings 
Be glad of first night nerves 
For fear gives courage wings 
Fear gives courage wings 

If I am on the sidelines 
Chances are you'll miss 
Wait alone and spotlit 
For Doctor Theatre's kiss 

The stage becomes a ship in flames 
I tie you to the mast 
Throw your body overboard 
The spotlight doesn't last 
The spotlight doesn't last 

I could be with you 
Or waiting in the wings 
Lift your heart with soaring song 
Cut down the puppet strings 
Cut down the puppet strings 

I may tap you on the shoulder 
And whisper "go" in red 
Strip your feet of lead my friend 
Strip your feet of lead 

Call the curtain 
Raise the roof 
Spirits on tonight 

Call the curtain 
Raise the roof 
Spirits on tonight 

Call the curtain 
Raise the roof 
Spirits on tonight 

We love our audience (repeat)
