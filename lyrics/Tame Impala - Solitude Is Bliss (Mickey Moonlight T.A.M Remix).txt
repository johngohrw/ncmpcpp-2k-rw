Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please
All the kicks that I can't compare to
Making friends like you're all supposed to

You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters, I don't care what I miss
Company's okay, solitude is bliss
There's a party in my head and no one is invited

And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel

Movement doesn't flow quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends can watch me, today
Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel

You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
