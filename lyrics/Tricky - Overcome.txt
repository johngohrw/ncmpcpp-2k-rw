You sure you want to be with me?
I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this loving's best
Whoa, leave us in emotional peace
Mmm, take a walk take a rest
And taste the rest

Don't wanna be on top of your list
Monopoly improperly kissed
We overcome in sixty seconds with the strength we have together
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed
And when there's trust there'll be treats
When we funk we'll hear beats

You and her, walking through the suburbs
No, not exactly lovers
You're a couple, oh, 'specially when your bodies double
Duplicate and then you wait
For the next Kuwait

Jamaican aroma, karmacoma

You sure you want to be with me?
I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this loving's best
Whoa, leave us in emotional peace
Mmm, take a walk take a rest
And taste the rest

Don't wanna be on top of your list
Monopoly improperly kissed
We overcome in sixty seconds with the strength we have together
But for now, emotional ties they stay severed
And when there's trust there'll be treats
When we funk we'll hear beats
