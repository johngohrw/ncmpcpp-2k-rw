Why you always wanna love the ones who hurt you?
Then break down when they go and desert you,
No, oh, no,
It's so hard to let 'em go.
And watch 'em scatter when you start asking questions,
Like why we always in the wrong direction?
Shame, such a shame,
But you're doing it again.

You don't wanna know more,
And you've been down this road before,
So leave it alone,
Just leave it alone.

And when you hear about the lies other people are sayin',
Just know they talk cause they don't have a way inside,
Oh, they try,
Look out, it hurts their pride.
You can never find a soul that's got no pain within,
Just like you'll never find a single without that sin, no sin,
Will it ever end?

You don't wanna know more,
And you've been down this road before,
So leave it alone,
Just leave it alone.
No this ain't nothing new,
The only thing you've got is you,
So leave it alone,
Just leave it alone.
