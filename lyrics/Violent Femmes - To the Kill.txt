Ain't had no fun, all the time jacking around
Ain't had no fun, messing my mind, I kick it around
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill

I ain't no kid in Chicago, I ain't no Al Capone
But there's a windy city in my bedroom alone
I said I don't live in Chicago, I don't know no Al Capone
That bitch took my money, and she went to Chicago
If I ain't already enough, sick and alone...
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill

Ain't had no fun, all the time jacking around
Ain't had no fun -- where's it at? It's down, down, it's downtown...
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill
