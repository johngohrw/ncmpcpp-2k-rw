Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Yeah we're still here now
We're still

Basic or Asic
I ain't tryna waste this
Took a long time cryin', cryin' ain't a crime
I got my mom, she passed away, my daddy ain't alive
Before they murdered Fudge I prayed for more time
Had y'all on my mind all week
I missed the last
They say a better tomorrow is to sacrifice the calf
Keep that cow in the pasture, knife in the drawer
It's been a long 40 days, it's gonna take 40 more
Make it through losin' love, sorta like rock few
I made the limits, I thought that I run the gas out
When you took your last breath, I only passed out
Laid in the better place but that left me ass out
Hearin' that voice goin' dependent on memory
[?] is fakin' now and I need that energy
Fake to perfection flesh, I should be thankful
From neck to ankle I'm physically [?]

Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Cause we're still here now
Yeah we're still here now
We're still

Dreams
Out of eternal dreams comes delusion
(Cause we're still here now)
Ride into our [?] Rolls-Royce, brown
You silver shadow yeah
(We're still)
Order now beers and wine and if the bar stool's empty
(Cause we're still here now)
And time is a dogma you can't escape
You can't escape, you can't escape
You think you know it, careful what you search for
Stare it in the face
(We're still)
Seasick on Pacific swell
I did it to myself
Stare it in the face
Next day radiant blue

How you gonna recognize it?
Think he cried more than me
How you gonna let go?
Just lookin' at, starin' at his face
How, how, how, how will you ever know?
Just lookin' at, starin' at his face
How will you ever know?
Think he cried more than me
Starin' at his face
Hey, ah, How will you ever know?
Starin' at his face
(Out here the only one)
How will you ever know?
How will you ever know?
Starin' at his face

Instead I hear your voice
I hear your voice
With me
With the way
Gone for now but here to stay
But here to stay
I will always place your memory
For now
