I'm in a vest

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Trust some ellipses to chase you round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo!

Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
Going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
3, 2, 1

Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Give me an eanie, meanie, minie, mo
Or an ip, dip, dog, shit, rock and roll
