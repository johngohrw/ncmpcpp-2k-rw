I got a brain in left hand drive
I don't asleep other side
I ride a bullet like I'm Steve McQueen
Each town I intervene
A gram of keef and the barn is jumping
It's alright we got time
Got a radio hit in mind
Can't see am I blind

Every night and day (I'll never forget)
In the U.S.A....I DELETE MYSELF

Got to know you gene by gene
You're my jellybean
Get out the shower
And I'm force 15
I'm dead I'm clean
Fatboy and the barn is jumping
It's alright it's just tight

GOT to GET into A better Business
DEEP down Happiness

Every night and day (I'll never forget)
In the U.S.A.... I delete myself

I delete myself
I delete myself
I delete myself
I delete myself
I delete myself
I delete myself
I delete myself
I delete myself
