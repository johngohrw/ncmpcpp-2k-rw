When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff -- yeah, I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite; I just might stop to check you out
Let me go on... like I blister in the sun
Let me go on... big hands, I know you're the one

My girlfriend, she's at the end -- she is starting to cry
Let me go on... like I blister in the sun
Let me go on... big hands, I know you're the one

When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff -- yeah, I'm so strung out
