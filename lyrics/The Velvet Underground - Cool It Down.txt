Somebody took the papers
And somebody's got the key
And somebody nailed the door shut
That says hey what you think that you see
But me I'm down around the corner
You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
Gives me double you L-O-V-E

Hey baby if you want it so fast
Don't you know that it ain't gonna last
Of course you know it makes no difference to me

Somebody's got the time time
Somebody's got the right
All of the other people
Tryin' to use up the night
But now me I'm out on the corner
You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
Gives me double you L-O-V-E

Ooh if you want it so fast
Don't you know honey you can get it so fast
But of course you know it makes no difference to me

Oh oh oh you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down

Oh hey if you want it so fast
Now lookie baby don't you want it to last
But of course you know that it makes no difference to me
Oh you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
