Baby, don't you cry
Baby, I'll sing you a lullabye


We're walking down the
Street of chance
Where the chance is always
Slim or none
And the intentions unjust


Baby there's nothing to see
I've already been
Down the street of chance


Baby you're so clean
Baby please stay clean
Baby you're so young
Baby please stay young
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, we've already cried
