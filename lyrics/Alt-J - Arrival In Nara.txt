As she submarines
The rope loops round her feeble feet
Before the dawn
Breaks on her sorry grasp

In a blink and in one motion
Rope constricts
Rips her towards the ocean

She never finds her bearings
Sucking splash into her lungs

Though I cannot see
I can hear her smile as she sings

And though I cannot see
I can hear her smile as she sings
