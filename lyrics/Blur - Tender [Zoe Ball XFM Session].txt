Tender is the night
Lying by your side
Tender is the touch
Of someone that you love too much
Tender is the day
The demons go away
Lord I need to find
Someone who can heal my mind

Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing 
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
I'm Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come

Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
[x2]

Tender is the ghost
The ghost I love the most
Hiding from the sun
Waiting for the night to come
Tender is my heart
I'm screwing up my life
Lord I need to find
Someone who can heal my mind

Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing 
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
I'm Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come

Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
[x2]

Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing 
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
I'm Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come

Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
[x2]

Tender is the night
Lying by your side
Tender is the touch
Of someone that you love too much
Tender is my heart you know
I'm screwing up my life
Oh Lord I need to find
Someone who can heal my mind

Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Get through it
Come on, Come on, Come on 
Love's the greatest thing 
That we have
I'm waiting for that feeling
I'm Waiting for that feeling
Waiting for that feeling to come

Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
