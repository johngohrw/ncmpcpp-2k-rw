Have you had enough excitement now
More than you ever did?
You never wanted to be treated like a woman
You maintained you was just a kid

Well at least you were of age, my dear
These days kids they grow so fast
You never wanted to be committed to the present
You're too busy believing in the past, oh

Who then was your savior?
Who then was your friend?
Who is now committed to the present?
Is it someone that exists?

What is life in God?
A perfect vision of the self?
I always thought we was a-dealing with one thing
Now we are dealing with something else, oh

Do you see my smoking guns?
They're smoking from a shootin'
Smoking from shootin'
Smokin' from shootin' at nothing here

Do you live your life on the road?
Yeah, losing out on loving
Asking for nothing
Runnin' from something that isn't there, oh

Who makes my decisions?
Who reads all your thoughts?
What makes us how we are?
Faith can't prove what science won't resolve

Kumbaya my Lord
C'mon, row your boat ashore
The river's long, it is cold
It chills the body but not the soul, oh

Do you see my smoking guns, yeah
They're smoking from a shootin'
Smoking from shootin'
Smokin' from shootin' at nothing here

Do you live your life on the road?
Yeah, losing out on loving
Asking for nothing
Runnin' from something that isn't there, oh

Distance- coming or going? c'mon
What are you waiting for?
Distance- growing or closing in on?
Anyway
