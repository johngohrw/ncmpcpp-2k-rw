The Cactus Where Your Heart Should BeThe Magnetic FieldsThe cactus where your heart should beHas lovely little flowersSo though it's always pricking me My ardor never soursThe cactus where your heart once wasHas power to rend and flayI stick because I'm stuck, becauseI just can't tear myself away[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:The_Cactus_Where_Your_Heart_Should_Be ]
