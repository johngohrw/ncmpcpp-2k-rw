This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
There's a,

Room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping to familiar ways

And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
And all the attention is leading me to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, we may as well go too far

Wriggling around and it's so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue
Struggling with the notion that it's life not film

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends their memories are pretend
And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
