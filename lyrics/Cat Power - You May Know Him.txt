Oh Lord heaven is the name that you sent me
Oh Lord heaven is the name that you gave him
And then he came to life and he lived
All others strange because who could of thought
That you meant so much to me

Oh Lord heaven is the name that you gave him
Surprised by the rise in sin you came through over and over again
Lord heaven is the place that you sent him

And you may know him
And you may know him only you
Lord i've never doubted for an instant
If we did what you say
And we do it everyday
If we did what you say
And we do it everyday

Lord if heaven is the place he believed in it's all you can do
Oh Lord heaven is the name that you sent me
Oh Lord surprised by the rise in sin you came through
You came through
