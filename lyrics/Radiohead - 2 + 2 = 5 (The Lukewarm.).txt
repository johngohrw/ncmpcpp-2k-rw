Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes up five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April's showers
And two and two always makes up five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because you have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

Oh

I try to sing along
I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
I swat em like flies
But like flies the buggers keep coming back
But I'm not
Oh hail to the thief
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the dock
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king that the sky is falling in
When it's not
When it's not
When it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
