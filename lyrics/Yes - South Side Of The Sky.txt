A river a mountain to be crossed
the sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
around the south side so cold that we cried
were we ever colder on that day a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

Move forward was my friends only cry
in deeper to somewhere we could lie
and rest for the day with cold in the way
were we ever colder on that day a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
a snow storm a stimulating voice
of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die
were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away
we seemed for all of eternity

The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
the river can disregard the cost
and melt in the sky warmth when you die
were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away
we seemed from all of eternity
