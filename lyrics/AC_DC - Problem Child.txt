Cop this
I'm hot, and when I'm not
I'm cold as ice
Get out of my way
Just Step aside
Or pay the price

What I want I take
What I don't I break
And I don't want you
With a flick of my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild

Make my stand
No man's land
On my own
Man in blue
It's up to you
The seed is sown

What I want I stash
What I don't I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive
I got a .45
And I never miss

I'm a problem child, hey
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Just runnin' wild

Just watch your step

Every night
Street light
I drink my booze
Some run
Some fight
But I win they lose
What I need I like
What I don't I fight
And I don't like you
Say bye bye
While you're still alive
Your time is through

Cause I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Even my mother hates me
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
(Problem child, problem child)
(Problem child, problem child), you got your problems I got mine
(Problem child, problem child)
(Problem child, problem child)
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Problem child
And I'm running wild
I'm a problem child
(Problem child, problem child...)
