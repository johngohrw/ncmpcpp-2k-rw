You're the kind of person that I've been dreaming of
You're the kind of person that I always wanted to love

And when I first seen you walk right through that bar door
And I seen those suit and tie johns buy you one drink
and then buy you some more, I had a

I know you had that crazy feeling
now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling
You know that I've had that crazy feeling, too
I can see it in your

You got that crazy feeling
now, now, now, now, now, you got that crazy feeling
I've had that crazy feeling, too

Now everybody knows that business ends at three
And everybody knows that after hours love is free

And you, you really are a queen
oh, such a queen, such a queen
And I know, 'cause I made the same scene
I know just what you mean, because

You got that crazy feeling
now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling
You got that crazy feeling deep inside
now, I can see it in your eyes

You got that crazy feeling
now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling
And you got that crazy feeling, too
I feel just like, feel just like you

(Crazy feeling, crazy feeling)
