Sally, things close early
It's a holiday, they tell me
How long have you lived here?
Have you seen the river?

Do you know the proper way
To ask for a cigarette?
I'm asking before winter comes

Stay here with me 'til morning
With the three-man orchestra playing
I ask a fortune-teller
What they whisper when I walk by

Do you know the proper way
To ask for a cigarette?
I'm asking before winter comes

"All the people run from the horizon"
"All the people run from the horizon"
"All the people run from the horizon"
"All the people run from the horizon"
"All the people run from the horizon"
Stay here waking nearby the horizon
"All the people run from the horizon"
