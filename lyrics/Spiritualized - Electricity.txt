Drivin' fast down a one way street,
Lord I love you you dance so sweet,
Goin' faster, hit the sky,
Lord I love it don't ask me why
Electricity, Let it rain all over me,
Let the light be forever green,
I'm playin' with fire if you know what I mean
I need someone to help me turn it on
Drivin' fast babe I'm on my own
I'm gonna meet you on a one way road
Gonna crash, kiss the sky
Lord I love you don't ask me why
Electricity, Let it wash all over me,
Let the light be forever green,
I'm playin' with fire if you know what I mean
I need someone to help me turn it on
Drivin' fast down a one way street,
Lord I love you you dance so neat,
Baby touch me hit the sky,
Baby touch me make me fly, I said
Electricity, Electricity, Electricity, Electricity
Turn it on.
