You claw, you fight, you lose
Got a doll that looks just like you
Remember when we used to say
"I love you" almost every day
I saw a light in you
Going out as I closed our window
You never liked me anyway

I don't see the light I saw in you before
And now I don't, and now I don't
And now I don't care anymore
(And now I don't care anymore)

Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroyed everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

You hate, you bite, you lose
After all, I just don't like you
It's nice that you say you like me
But only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect flow
It got lost when you gave it up though
Cause you want money
You want fame

I don't see the light I saw in you before
And now I don't, and now I don't
And now I don't care any more
(And now I don't care any more)

Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroyed everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroyed everything that you love
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

(Uncontrollable)
