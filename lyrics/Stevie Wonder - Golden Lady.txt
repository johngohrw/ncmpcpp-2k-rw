Looking in your eyes 
Kind of heaven eyes 
Closing both my eyes 
Waiting for surprise 
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far 
Cause I'm not afraid to try and go it 
To know the love and the beauty never known before 
I'll leave it up to you to show it 

And golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Take me right away 

Looking at your hands 
Hands can understand 
Waiting for the chance 
Just to hold your hand 
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow 
Into a lovely smile that's blooming 
And it's so clear to me that you're a dream come true 
There's no way that I'll be losing 

And golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Take me right away 

A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow 
Into a lovely smile that's blooming 
And it's so clear to me that you're my dream come true 
There is no way that I'll be losing 

Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there 
Golden lady, golden lady 
I'd like to go there
