But don't remind me of home, there's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
And don't remind me of home or I might notice where I am

It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change

And gazing out the window as I ascend into the sky

But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change

Yeah, I do, yeah, I do
But don't remind me of home, incase it isn't quite the same
