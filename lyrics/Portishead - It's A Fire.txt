Its a fire
These dreams they pass me by
This salvation I desire
Keeps getting me down

Cos we need to
Recognise mistakes
For time and again

So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail.... ...

Cos this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, sister breathe on

[INSTRUMENTAL]

From this oneself
Testify or tell
Its fooling us now

So let it be known for what we believe in
I can see no reason for it to fail...

Cos this life is a farce
I can't breathe through this mask
Like a fool
So breathe on, little sister, breathe on
Ohh so breathe on, little sister, like a fool
