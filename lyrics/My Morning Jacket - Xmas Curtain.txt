Hey
The Christmas curtain falls on lawbreakers who pave the way
For thoughtless folks like me and J. who'd pay
But can't afford the finer things in life
So we heist them all
We're criminals that never break the law

So
To all you frowns, go down to town square and get some action
From the Christmas girl that lives inside your womb
She's always there, I think that I'm certain
You pay to get behind her Christmas curtain
You're the criminal that never breaks the law
