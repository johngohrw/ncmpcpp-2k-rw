Keys cut, three for the price of one
And nothing's free, but guaranteed for a lifetime's use
I've changed the locks, and you can't have one
You, you know the other two

The brakes have worn so thin that you could hear
I hear them screeching through the door from our driveway
Hey, love, look into your glovebox heart
What is there for me inside, this love is tired
I've changed the locks, have I misplaced you?

Have we lost our minds?
Will this never end?
It could depend on your take

You, me, we used to be on fire
If keys are all that stand between
Can I throw in the ring?
No gasoline, just fuck me, kitten
You are wild, and I'm in your possession
Nothing's free, so fuck me, kitten

I'm in your possession
So fuck me, kitten
