I warned you baby from time to time
You don't listen so pay me no mind

Too bad you're blue

Mister Engineer with your throttle in hand
Take me back to that Southern land
It called moving
Keep a rolling on
You're flying too high
For my old sky
I'll move on
Mister Fireman please woncha listen to me

Keep a rolling on
You're flying too high
