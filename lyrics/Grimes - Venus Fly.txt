Oh, why you looking at me again?
Oh, why you looking at me again?

Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth?
Cut my hair underneath my chin
Wrapped my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feel my beat like a snacker girl
(If I want it more)

Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me
I'm dancing
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me against them?

Kitty, kitty, kitty cat
Why you always doing that?
Why you always talking smack?
Yeah, Grimes got my back
Kitty, kitty, kitty cat
Why you always doing that?
Why you always talking smack?
Grimes

Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth?
Cut my hair underneath my chin
Wrapped my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feel my beat like a snacker girl
(If I want it more)

Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me
I'm dancing
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me against them?

The floor
What about?
Again
Boy you looking at me
Again
Again
Hey, oh why you looking at me
Oh, why you looking at me?
Me against them
