La la la la la la, la la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 

Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

[CHORUS]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away

Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

[CHORUS]
See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's a memory of the summer day

[CHORUS (twice)]
La la la la la la [repeat]
