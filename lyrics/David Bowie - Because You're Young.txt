Psychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy 
don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
she can't talk any more

What are they trying to prove?
What would they like to find?

It's love back to front and no sides
like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

[CHORUS]
Because you're young 
you'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young -
what could be nicer for you 
and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard 
was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides 
like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

[CHORUS]

A million dreams
A million scars
A million [repeat ad inf.]
