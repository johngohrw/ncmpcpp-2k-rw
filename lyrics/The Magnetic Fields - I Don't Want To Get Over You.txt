I Don't Want To Get Over YouThe Magnetic FieldsI don't want to get over youI guess I could take a sleeping pillAnd sleep at willAnd not have to go throughWhat I go throughI guess I should take Prozac, right?And just smile all nightAt somebody newSomebody not too brightBut sweet and kindWho would try to get you off my mindI could leave this agony behindWhich is just what I'd doIf I wanted toBut I don't want to get over you'Cause I don't want to get over loveI could listen to my therapistPretend you don't exist And not have to dream ofWhat I dream ofI could listen to all my friendsAnd go out againAnd pretend it's enoughOr I could make a career of being blueI could dress in black and read CamusSmoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouthLike I was seventeenThat would be a screamBut I don't want to get over you[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:I_Don%27t_Want_To_Get_Over_You ]
