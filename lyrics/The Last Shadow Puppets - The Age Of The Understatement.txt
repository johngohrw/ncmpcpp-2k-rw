Decided
To sneak up away
From your stomach
And try your pulse
And captured
What seemed all
Unknowing and candid
But they suspected
It was false
 
She's playful
The boring would
Warn you be careful
Of her brigade
In order to tame
This relentless marauder
Move away from the parade
 
And she was walking on the tables
In the glass house
Endearingly bedraggled in the wind
Subtle in her method of seduction
The twenty little tragedies begin
 
And she would throw
A feather boa in the road
If she thought
That it would set the scene
Unfittingly dipped
Into your companions
Enlighten them to make you seethe
 
And there's affection to rent
The age of the understatement
Before the attraction ferments
Kiss me properly and pull me apart
 
Affection to rent
The age of the understatement
Before this attraction ferments
Kiss me properly and pull me apart
 
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 
And my fingers scratch at my hair
Before my mind can get too reckless
The idea of seeing you here
Is enough to make the sweat grow cold
 
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
