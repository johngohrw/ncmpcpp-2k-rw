You know I've got to leave here
If I can pull myself up to the door
You see I've tried my best to stay here
But I can't see you anymore

There's something I've just gotta tell you
There's something keeps bringing me down, you know
There's one thing more I've just gotta ask you once again now, baby
Won't you please let me go?

If I'm to meet my master
If I'm to rule my fate
You know it couldn't come any faster, babe
But see I know it's not too late

Time has not been good for us
No time has not been kind
We've done all that we could for us
More time won't change my mind

And when my life is over
And I'm walking out in the rain
Let me lie down in the clover
And look up to the sun again

It's not that I did not love you
But something kept bringing me down, you know
There's something that I've just gotta tell you once again now, baby
Let me go, 
let me go...
let me go,
let me go...
let me go,
let me go...
