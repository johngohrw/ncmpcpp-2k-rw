Long-Forgotten FairytaleThe Magnetic FieldsSomeone told me you'd be hereWhispering these familiar thingsTalking to my little pet, smoking the same old cigarettesI would have laughedI saw you last in summertimeYou said you hated long goodbyesYou said, "There's nothing to explain, in every life a little rain"?EtceteraAnd a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes againAnd I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intenseAnd nothing is making senseThere's a floating town of ire down in a mist of mysteryThere's an old enchanted castle and the princess there is meDecked-out like a Christmas treeI guess you've had your little jokeBut I have lost my sense of humorMy medication's wearing off, for it's just not strong enoughTo cover thisThen you kissed me like before I found myself wanting moreAnd you tell that little lie that kept me hypnotizedAnother kissAnd a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes againAnd I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intenseAnd nothing is making senseThere's a floating town of ire down in a mist of mysteryThere's an old enchanted castle and the princess there is meDecked-out like a Christmas treeIf somebody told me I'd succumbIf someone said I'd be so dumbAfter all the sleepless nights, when I turned on all the lightsI would have hit themBut I have turned the other cheekMy voice trembles, my knees are weakAnd you beat me once againAnd I know what happens thenYou raise the anteAnd a long-forgotten fairytale is in your eyes againAnd I'm caught inside a dream world where the colors are too intenseAnd nothing is making senseThere's a floating town of ire down in a mist of mysteryThere's an old enchanted castle and the princess there is meDecked-out like a Christmas tree[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Long-Forgotten_Fairytale ]
