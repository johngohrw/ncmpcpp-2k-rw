[Excerpt from "Mothercreep":]
Whisper in tongues
Hit me with your hands
Double knot my throat, mother [x2]

In words I lose
Don't be mad
Advocating every second, every minute
To my mind it's so sweet
And I wish you could see it

I'll be home soon
I'll be there

[Verse 1:]
Do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
Are you watching me cause I move alone?

Look a little harder
Everything I hold is wet
And I've never tasted glass and patron

I wait all week for a moment's
Break away from being told who I am

So do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
I can't wait to make your body my own

[Hook x2:]
1, 2, 3â€¦
Now hold that pose for me

[Verse 2:]
Do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
Are you watching me cause I move alone?

Look a little harder
Shut your eyes and feel the rush
Will you fuck me while I stare at the sun?

We, we, all we do
Yeah, girls talk
When you've got a front row seat to this dance

Do you have a lighter?
Am I dancing sexy yet?
Cause I've never tasted glass and patron

[Hook x2]

[Bridge:]
Know what you want, what you need
But only when you're tasting doubt
Plead yourself to rise from ashes built from lustin' for it
You are phoenix, you are fire, you are everything
I just want for you to love me

Nature plays a wicked game
Swallow spartans for the pain
Let her hold him to his chest

Hold that pose [x16]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Now hold that pose for me [x3]
