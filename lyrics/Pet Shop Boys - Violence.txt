The sons and brothers, fighting for another cause
Anything to give their lives some meaning
Busy with their guns and dreaming
Far away from here
Said they would act in self-defense

And all the others, running 'round so hot and bothered
Anything to give their lives some meaning
In the evening
Running around with guns and
Said they would act in self-defense
With violence

Violence
Violence
Violence breeds
Violence
Violence breeds

The son and brother, when he gets home
He gives someone some love
And mutters: "Woman, you'll never understand
I did what I said in self-defense
With violence"

Violence breeds
Violence
Violence breeds
Violence
Violence breeds
