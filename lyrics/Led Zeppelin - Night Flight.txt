I received a message from my brother across the water 
He sat laughin' as he wrote the end's in sight 
So I said goodbye to all my friends 
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox 
'Cause I know it's time to fly 

Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night 
The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright 

I just jumped a train that never stops, 
So now somehow I'll know I never finished payin' for my ride 
Just n' someone pushed a gun into my hand 
Tell me I'm the type of man to fight the fight that I'll require 

Come on, meet me in the morning, Meet me in the middle of the night 
The morning light is comin', don't it make you wanna go and feel alright 

Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leavin' 
Nothin' here to make me stay 
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm goin' 
They're knockin' down them doors 
They're tryin' to take me away 

Please Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell. And ring loud and clear 
Please Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell 
Tell the people they got to fly away from here 

I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby 
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile 
We are in the middle of a change in destination 
When the train stops, all together we will smile 
Oh, meet me in the morning. 
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night 
Everybody know the mornin' time is comin' 
Don't it make you wanna feel alright. Ah, ah, yeah 
Make me feel alright. Fly now, baby 
Get to fly, yeah. Fly now, baby
