It's the flies
They are so annoying
(Shut up you fool, she's here)
Ladies and gents
Crystal carrying pixie peasants and warriors
Elders, ancestors, sons and daughters
Lion hearted kings and everything in between
Take a seat, be witness

You consider 'em king, about to icing on cakes
Chariots cruise at tortoise speeds
Lay your bifocals on royalty
Longer than Sears catalogue
Stern like matadors and [?] LPs
Mirror the crimson tide
The color of the Rubics
Them duplex fuse got your nose up
But coozy up to this warmth though
That long term froze is up
The jone is up
I get swallowed by the barracuda
Androids read raps off iPhones
I choke the blood out of felt tips
Heavy weights up to the front if the belt fits
The wealth is like ivory toothpicks
One out of each tusk
And must gets bust for each and every hiccup
Salute life when dawn breaks
Foreign colors foreign mink lapel’s on these royalty capes
I repeat, salute life when dawn breaks
Foreign colors foreign mink lapel’s on these royalty capes
Royalty

Behold this divine alignment scrolled secretly in cloud formations. Waterfall rythmes from crowns containing galaxies. Gems from past dimensions. A bond so strong it has unbreakable status. Spits hieroglyphic scripture like a god from Atlantis

Us three be the omega like fish oil
This royal right be own no rentals
Owners of the cape express
He went from the mind you ate off the plate of fundamentals
Knocked on every door of the country's red rugs
We'll lay on floors
We walk and etched in like testament
And find the atomic number 79
On Vernon's periodic table we dine upon
Sittin' on thrones gettin' blown to bits
By our royal dime, fillet of fine dinin'
News from the east sire
Them east coast kings are still findin' ways to stay on
On for play on like a damn disease
Spread the word of Ramseys and fry up a pan of these
Salute down when day breaks
And give me my checks with the same first name as the cape
I repeat salute down when day breaks
And give me my checks with the same first name as the capes
We are royalty

We are an army of stars unleashed
The sky takes notes when we speak
Our capes move with the wind
Because of the wings beneath
This is royalty
The sky takes notes when we speak
Our capes move with the wind
Because of the wings beneath
This is royalty
