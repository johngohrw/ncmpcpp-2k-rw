Let's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway 
while color lights up your face
Let's sway 
sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance for fear 
your grace should fall
Let's dance for fear tonight is all

Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance put on your red shoes 
and dance the blues

Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight
