Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
You lie and you lie and you lie

Nineteen to keep
Looking at the game though
Trying to make a stand for the main squeeze
Please
You don't stand a chance
Stop acting like you can
The camera's on you, ain't that enough?
You're looking for the all around good love

[Pre-Chorus:]
So nothing's gonna get in your way
You're gonna get yourself broke one day

[Chorus:]
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Stop, stop lying to me
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
You lie and you lie and you lie

Nineteen, I see, a body that can move
The hardest in the room
With a quick switch, kiss
Got all eyes on you now
What you gonna do?
The camera loves you, ain't that enough?
You're craving for the whole universe

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Got something to say?
I don't want to hear about it
So you feeling the fame
I hate the things you're going through now
What you gonna do?

[Chorus]

You lie and you lie and you lie
You lie and you lie and you lie
You lie and you lie and you lie

(I don't recognize me)
