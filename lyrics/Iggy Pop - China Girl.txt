I couldn't escape this feeling
With my China Girl
I'm just a wreck without
My little China Girl
I'd hear hearts beating
Loud as thunder
See the stars crashing


I'm a mess without
My China Girl
Wake up mornings, there's
No China Girl
I'd hear hearts beating
Loud as thunder
I'd see stars crashing down


I'd feel tragic
Like I was Marlon Brando
When I'd look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing
Really meant too much
When I'd look at my China Girl


I'd stumble into town
Just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
And plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes


My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world


And when I get excited
My little China Girl says,
"Oh Jimmy, just shut your mouth."
She says, "Shhhh..."
