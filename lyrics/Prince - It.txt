I think about IT baby all the time, all right
IT feels so good IT must be a crime, all right
I wanna do IT baby every day, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right
I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

I could be guilty 4 my honesty, all right
But I've got 2 tell U what U mean 2 me, all right (all right)
With U I swear, I'm a maniac, all right
U see IT ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right

I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

Doin' IT, doin' IT, doin' IT, doin' IT

(come on)
(come on)

I could be guilty 4 my honesty, all right
But I've got 2 tell U what U mean 2 me, all right

(yeah - I wanna)

I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

I wanna do IT baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

I wanna do U baby all the time, all right
Cuz when we do IT girl, IT's so divine, all right

(U wanna) think about IT, (U wanna) think about IT (baby, all the time)

Feels so good IT must be a crime

Doin' IT, doin' IT, doin' IT, doin' IT
