Well Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
Joey's almost strong
Bet your life he's putting us on
Oh lordy
Oh lordy
You know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

[Chorus:]
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
Don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

Shadow love was quick and keen
Life's a well thumbed machine
Saw you watching from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh lordy
Oh lordy
You know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

[Chorus x2]

Dancing
Won't someone dance with me?
Touch me
