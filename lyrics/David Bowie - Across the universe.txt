[Written by John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
[Originally performed by The Beatles in the album "Let It Be"]

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup 
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[CHORUS (twice)]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a 
Million eyes
They call me on and on 
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my 
open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

[CHORUS (twice)]
