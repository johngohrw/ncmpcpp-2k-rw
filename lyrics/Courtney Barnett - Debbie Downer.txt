Tell me when you're getting bored and I'll leave
I'm not the one who put the chain around your feet
I'm sorry for all of my insecurities, but they're just a part of me
"Envy is thin because it bites but never eats"
That's what a nice old Spanish lady once told me
"Hey Debbie-Downer turn that frown upside down and just be happy"

I don't ask too much of you
It's true and I can't read your mind

Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments

I'm growing older every time I blink my eyes
Boring, neurotic, everything that I despise
We had some lows, we had some mids, we had some highs
Sell me all your golden rules and I'll see
If that's the kind of person that I wanna be
If I'm not happy I'll be glad I kept receipts

I won't ask too much of you
I used to wonder what to wear

Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments

Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished yet
I'm not fishing for your compliments
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished
Don't stop listening, I'm not finished
I'm not finished
