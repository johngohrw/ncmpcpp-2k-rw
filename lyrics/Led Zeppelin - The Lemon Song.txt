I should have quit you, long time ago. [X2]
I wouldn't be here, my children, down on this killin' floor. 

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind [X2]
Everytime I go away and leave you, darling, you send me the blues way down the line. 

Said, people worry I can't keep you satisfied. 
Let me tell you baby, you ain't nothin but a two-bit, no-good jive. 

Went to sleep last night, worked as hard as I can, 
Bring home my money, you take my money, give it to another man. 
I should have quit you, baby, such a long time ago. 
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles, down on this killing floor. 

Squeeze me baby, till the juice runs down my leg. [X2]
The way you squeeze my lemon, I'm gonna fall right out of bed. 

I'm gonna leave my children down on this killing floor.
