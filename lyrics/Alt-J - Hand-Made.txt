Your sting red full stops my skin, dotted, scratch scratch, now I’m bleeding.
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings.
There’s bears in the wood and they’re out to get me,
And I’m safe from harm if I stay in this chalet.
And hold me tight and I’ll sink in,
I’m absorbed in your thinking,

But you don’t know.
You-ooooo...
But you don’t know.
You-ooooo...

Your sting red full stops my skin, dotted, scratch scratch, now I’m bleeding.
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings
For you-oooo...
For you-oooo..........
