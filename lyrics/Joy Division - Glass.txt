Hearts fail, young hearts fail,
Anytime, pressurised,
Overheat, overtired,
Take it quick, take it neat,
Clasp your hands, touch your feet,
Take it quick, take it neat,
Take it quick, take it neat.

Hearts fail, young hearts fail,
Anytime, wearing down,
On the run, underground,
Put your hand where it's safe,
Leave your hand where it's safe.

Do it again,
Do it again and again and again...

Anytime, that's your right.
Don't you wish you do it again,
Overheat, overtired.
Don't you wish you do it again...
Anytime, that's your right...
Don't you wish you do it again...
I bet you wish you do it again
Do it again...
