Imitation red carnation
Nothing is new and either are you

It's what you say you don't do
Bottom of your well, that's where you fell

Majorette like there's nothing left
If there was nothing left to lose
Then you'd have something to prove

And you would never tip your hat
Has it come to that
Watch it spin like that

Watch you spin like that
