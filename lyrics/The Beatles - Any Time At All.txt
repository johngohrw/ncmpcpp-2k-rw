Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right

If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
