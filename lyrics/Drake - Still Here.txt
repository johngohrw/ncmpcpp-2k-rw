Doin' well dog
Yeah, me and all my
Yeah, me
Yeah

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here dog

How did I finesse all this shit from Jane and Weston
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son tho
Nothing mutual about my funds, bout my funds tho
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at
How they feel about you , where you're from, where your bed at
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time tho
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine, but I do know

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here dog

Oh, and I'm back dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I got talk to God even though he isn't near me
Based on what I got it's hard to think he don't hear me
Hidden like that 30 on my jersey man I'm gifted
Whole lot of 6's but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6 point star, lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell dog
Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still
