Should've kept on goin'
But the hurt was showing when she looked at me that way
I had to stay
I knew I had to get to know her name

The town was weary
She was to marry someone planned years ago
Her eyes said no
I knew I had to get to know her name

And when I got her all alone
She told me through the tears
That she didn't really love him
But he'd waited for so many years

She said she couldn't break his heart
She'd rather live with hers
And though I told her she should leave with me
She just could not believe with me

Should've kept on goin'
Better that than knowin' that he made her his wife
He took her life
You know I didn't even know her name
You know I didn't even know her name
