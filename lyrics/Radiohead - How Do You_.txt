He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong
He wants us to listen, he wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy because he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
