This dance
This dance
It's like a weapon
Like a weapon
Of self defense
Self defense
Against the present
Against the present
Present tense

I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'm dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind

In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost

I won't turn around when the penny drops
I won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain

Stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
That all this love
Could be in vain

In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
