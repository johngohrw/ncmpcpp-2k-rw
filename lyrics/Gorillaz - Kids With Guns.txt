Kids with guns
Taking over
But it won't be long
They're mesmerized

Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

Drinking out (is she real, is she)
Pacifier (is she real, is she)
Vitamin souls (is she real, is she)
The street desire (is she real, is she)
Doesn't make sense to (is she real, is she)
But it won't be long (is she real, is she)

Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
There you are
Doesn't make side to
But it won't be long
Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Is she, is she real, is she
Is she real, is she (it's real)
Is she, is she real, is she
Is she real, is she (it's real)
[etc]

Is she is she real
