I'm on a submarine mission for you baby
I feel the way you were going
I picked you up on my tv screen
I feel your undercurrent flowing

Submission going down down
Dragging me down submission
I can't tell ya what I've found

You've got me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in heaven above

Submission going down down
Dragging me down submission
I can't tell you what I've found
For there's a mystery
Under the sea in the water
Come and share it

Submission going down down
Dragging me down submission
I can't tell ya what I've found
'Cause it's a secret
Under the water in the sea
Octopus Rock

Got me pretty deep baby
I can't figure out your watery love
I gotta solve your mystery
You're sitting it out in heaven above

Submission going down down
Dragging me down submission
I can't tell ya what I've found

Submission Submission
Going down down under the sea
I wanna drown drown under the water
Going down down under the sea
