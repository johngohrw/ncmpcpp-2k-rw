Given the chance I'll die like a baby
On some far away beach
When the season's over

Unlikely I'll be remembered
As the tide brushes sand in my eyes
I'll drift away

Cast up on a plateau with only one memory
A single syllable
Oh lie low, lie low
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
