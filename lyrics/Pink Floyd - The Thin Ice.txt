Momma loves her baby 
And Daddy loves you too 
And the sea may look warm to you Babe 
And the sky may look blue 
Ooooh Babe 
Ooooh Baby Blue 
Ooooh Babe 
If you should go skating 
On the thin ice of modern life 
Dragging behind you the silent reproach 
Of a million tear stained eyes 
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice 
Appears under your feet 
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind 
With your fear flowing out behind you 
As you claw the thin ice
