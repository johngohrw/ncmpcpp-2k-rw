Hazy four o'clock shadows 
Commence the seance 
Nine lives on the spirits 

'Til the desert suns prevail 
In every scream eternal 

Locks out boredom forever 
Paints your fishes black 

It's so exciting 
Separate hearts 
Midnight 

Midnight close 

Almost crying 
Underneath the vine 
Fly like the jet 
The tan and white 
Evening 

I hear whistling 
In my ear wax 
Seven shapes 
Black
