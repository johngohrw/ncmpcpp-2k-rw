Jimmy came from Carolina - Wants to know a way to earn a dollar
Says he's suffering with a fever, just like Sister Ray says
I'm searching for my mainline, I couldn't hit it sideways

Jimmy's got a new piece, lying cold for a quarter hour
Took it out of his suitcase, shot him dead right on the floor
Hey man, you shouldn't do that, don't you know you'll stain the carpet
Hey man, you shouldn't do that, just like Sister Ray says

Too busy sucking on a ding dong, hey don't you know you'll stain the carpet
Too busy sucking on my ding dong, hey you know you shouldn't do that
I'm searching for my mainline, I couldn't hit it sideways
I'm searching for my mainline, going to count one, two, three, four

Jimmy came from Carolina, wants to know a way to earn a dollar
Says he didn't like the weather, it's just like Sister Ray says
Hit on it Jim

Had a good night

Jimmy's got a new piece, cold hearted for the fingering
Took it out in front of him, shot him dead right on the floor
Hey man, you shouldn't do that, hey don't you know you'll stain the carpet
It's just like Sister Ray said
Just like Sister Ray said

Had a good night
Just like Sister Ray said
