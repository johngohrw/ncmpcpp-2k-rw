Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention 
to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, 
he's got more channels
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my T V C one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five
Oh, so demonic, 
oh my T V C one five

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading 

"Send back 
my dream test baby, 
She's my main feature"
My T V C one five, he, he just 
Stares back unblinking
So hologramic,
oh my T V C one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby, then

We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
My baby's in there someplace
Love's rating in the sky
So hologramic,
oh my T V C one five

Oh my T V C one five,

Oh my T V C one five, 
oh oh, T V C one five
Oh my T V C one five, 
oh oh, T V C one five
