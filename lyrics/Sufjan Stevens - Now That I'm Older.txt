It's different now I think
I wasn't older yet
I wasn't wise, I guess
Somewhere I lost whatever else I had 
I wasn't over you
I see it run inside itself
And then I called you out
I'm not such older than I was
I'm feeling so much righter now
And then I woke myself, confused
Your dress comes down
To you, don't get it wrong, don't get excited
I wanted so much to be at rest
Now that I'm older
So be it so of love

The silent man comes down
All dressed in radiant colors
You see it for yourself
To demonstrate my love for you
You I thought I was so in love
Some say it wasn't true
Now that I'm older
Now, now that I'm older

There's so much travel
And now that I'm older
Someone else, can see it for myself
So much travel, yeah
Now that I'm older
