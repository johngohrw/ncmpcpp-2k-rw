Sir Greendown
Come wake me in the night
The dragon wants a bite
Of our love

The flower and the golden hand
Wooden wings and clouds of sand

Sir Greendown
Let's leave in an hour
Meet me at the tower
Ride your horse

Here the dolphins walk like men
Here the cyborgs have a plan
Sir Greendown
I need your shining light

Let's leave in an hour
Meet me at the tower
I'm in love.
