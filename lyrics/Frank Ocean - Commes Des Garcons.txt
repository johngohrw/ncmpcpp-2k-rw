He came up in Dallas
Had no hazel in his eyes
Had them sailors on his thighs when these ladies show him
Kept it faded on the side, he was seeing someone
He was dating on the side, he was seeing double
I was spending mula
He was spending so much time
It was getting cooler
All this drillin' got the dick feeling like a power tool
Feelin' [?]
Nigga [?] house now, that's a power move
That's what I gotta do, for real
Shine for real
Shine for real

Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
Feelings come, feelings go
