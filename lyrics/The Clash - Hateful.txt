Well, I got a friend who's a man
Who's a man? What man?
The man who keeps me from the lovely

He gives me what I need
What you need? What you got?
I need it all so badly

[Chorus]
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere

This year I've lost some friends
Some friends? What friends?
I dunno, I ain't even noticed

You see, I gotta go out again
Again? My friend
I gotta see that mainman

[Chorus x2]

I killed all my nerves
My nerves? What swerves?
And I can't drive so steady
And already

I've lost my memory
My mind? Behind!
I can't see so clearly

[Chorus]
