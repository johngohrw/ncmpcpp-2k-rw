Day after day 
They send my friends away 
To mansions cold and grey 
To the far side of town 
Where the thin men stalk the streets 
While the sane stay underground 

Day after day 
They tell me I can go 
They tell me I can blow 
To the far side of town 
Where it's pointless to be high 
'Cause it's such a long way down 
So I tell them that 
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm 

I will do me harm 
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all...am I? 

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be 
Just my librium and me 
And my E.S.T. makes three 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free 

And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me 

(Where can the horizon lie 
When a nation hides 
Its organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim) 

Day after day 
They take some brain away 
Then turn my face around 
To the far side of town 
And tell me that it's real 
Then ask me how I feel 

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all 
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be 
My libido's split on me 
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen 
Roaming free And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content 
They're all as sane as me
