Slip back out of whack at your best.
It's a nightmare,
So I'm joining the army.

No house phones, but can i still call?
Will you wait for me now?

We got the right to live, fight to use it,
Got everything but you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way.
I'll wait for you.

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
I want, what's better for you,

So long, my friend and adversary.
But I'll wait for you.

Get dressed, jump out of bed and do it best.
Are you OK?
I've been out around this town
Everybody's singing the same song for ten years.

I'll wait for you.
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
In our land are all closed eyes.
They've said it a billion times and they'll say it again.
So long my adversary and friend.

Don't go that way.
I'll wait for you.

I'm tired of all your friends,
Knocking down your door.
Get up in the morning, yelling no more,
So long, my friend and adversary.
I'll wait for you.
