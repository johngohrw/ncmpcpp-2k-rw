Oh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man?
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high?

Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along

[CHORUS]
Can you hear it fall
Can you hear it well
Can you hear it at all

I was really feeling good
Reet Petite and how d'ya do
Then I got the small red box
And I didn't know what to do
'Cause my fingers 
could not grope
And I could not give it away
And I knew I must not drop it
Stop it, take it away

Can you hear it at all
Can you hear it at all

Red Money [four times]

Such responsibility
It's up to you and me
