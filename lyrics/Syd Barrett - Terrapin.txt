I really love you and I mean you
The star above you, crystal blue
Well, oh, baby, my hair's on end about you...
I wouldn't see you and I love to
I fly above you, yes, I do
Well, oh baby, my hair's on end about you...

Floating, bumping, noses dodge a tooth
The fins are luminous
Fangs all 'round the clown
Is dark below the boulders hiding all
The sunlight's good for us
'Cause we're the fishes and all we do
The move about is all we do
Well, oh, baby, my hair's on end about you...

Floating, bumping, noses dodge a tooth
The fins are luminous
Fangs all 'round the clown
Is dark below the boulders hiding all
The sunlight's good for us
'Cause we're the fishes and all we do
The move about is all we do
Well, oh, baby, my hairs on end about you...

I really love you and I mean you
The star above you, crystal blue
Well, oh, baby, my hair's on end about you...
