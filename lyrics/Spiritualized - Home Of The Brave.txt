I don't even feel it
But lord how I need it
When I'm not with her
I'm not all myself
Sometimes have my breakfast right
Off of a mirror
And sometimes I have it
Right out of a bottle
Come on

I'm gonna rip it up
Tear it out
Gotta get it off of my soul
I don't even miss you

But that's 'cause I'm f**ked up
And sure when it wears off
Then I will be hurting
And just 'cause the sun shines
When you're out of my time
And just 'cause I feel bad
And feel good to fly high
Come on
Come on

I'm gonna rip it up
Tear it out
Gotta get you off of my soul
