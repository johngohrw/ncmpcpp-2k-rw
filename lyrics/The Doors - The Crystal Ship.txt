Before you slip into unconsciousness 
I'd like to have another kiss 
Another flashing chance at bliss 
Another kiss, another kiss 

The days are bright and filled with pain 
Enclose me in your gentle rain 
The time you ran was too insane 
We'll meet again, we'll meet again 

Oh tell me where your freedom lies 
The streets are fields that never die 
Deliver me from reasons why 
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly 

The crystal ship is being filled 
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills 
A million ways to spend your time 
When we get back, I'll drop a line
