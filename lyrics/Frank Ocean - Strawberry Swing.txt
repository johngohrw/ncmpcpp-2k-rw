when we were kids
we handpainted strawberries on a swing
every moment was so precious then
i'm still kicking it
i'm daydreaming
on a strawberry swing
the entire earth is fighting
all the world is at its end
just in case
an atom bomb
comes falling on my lawn
i should say
and you should hear
i've loved
i've loved the good times here
i've loved our good times here

say hello
then say farewell
to the places you know
we are all mortals aren't we
any moment this could go
cry cry cry even though
that won't change a thing
but you should know
you should hear
that i have loved
i have loved the good times here
and i will miss
our good times here

spaceships are lifting off
of a dying world
and millions are left behind
while the sky burns
there wasn't room for you and i
only you
goodbye
goodbye
