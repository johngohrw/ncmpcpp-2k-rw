It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah

It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now
Mama

Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless - so hopeless to even try
