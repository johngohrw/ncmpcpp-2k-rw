We got ourselves another one
We got ourselves another Jane Doe
I never let the others go
But everytime I look around they fall

See the shadow men bow down to the head of our baby, cough cough
If it isn’t more then why do I feel that I’m split in half
(Half, half, half)

Babe, don’t look the other way
I love your face and there’s no more time
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
It’s ugly but it is all I want
Babe, they call me the medicine man
But my own spurs don’t work anymore

Don’t ask for me to more kid
I think you’ll only find a grave man
Just take a look outside the walls
And try to tell me something that’s good man

By my neck I feel some great weight the chupacabra clings on
That’s the river my big god lives it’s gotta mean somethings wrong
(Wrong, wrong, wrong)

Babe, don’t look the other way
I love your face and there’s no more time
Babe, I saw what you did tonight
It’s ugly but it is all I want
Babe, they call me the medicine man
But my own spurs don’t work anymore
