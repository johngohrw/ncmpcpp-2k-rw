Decide yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason: it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't Country at all

Radio station: decide yourself

Keep me out of Country and the word
Wheel of fortune's leading us: absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the floor
That this isn't nothing at all

Straight off the boat, where to go

Calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe (radio)

Decide: defy the media too fast
Instead of pushing palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't fortunate at all

Radio station: decide yourself

We're calling out in transit
Calling out in transit
Radio Free Europe (radio)

Decide yourself: come in on a boat 
Media's too fast
Keep me out of Country and the word
Disappointment into us: absurd

Straight off the boat, where to go?
