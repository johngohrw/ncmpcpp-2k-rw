I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah. . .

And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah. . .

White man, white man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?

Oh the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah. . .

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race

White man, white man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed?

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forget how to learn
