I need a camera to my eye
To my eye, reminding
Which lies I have been hiding
which echoes belong
I've counted out days
to see how far
I've driven in the dark
with echoes in my heart

Phone my family, tell them I'm lost 
on the sidewalk
and, no, it's not OK

I smashed a camera
I wanna know why
To my eye deciding 
which lies i have been hiding
Which echoes belong
I'm counting on
a heart I know by heart
to walk me through this war
Memories distort

Phone my family, tell them I'm lost 
on the sidewalk
and, no, it's not OK

I've counted out
and no one knows how far
I've driven in the dark
with echoes in my heart

Phone my family, tell them I'm lost 
Yeah, I'm lost
and, no, it's not OK
