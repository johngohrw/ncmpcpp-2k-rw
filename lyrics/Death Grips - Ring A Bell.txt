America, America, now I’m coming Africa
My death is money
Whose bad? His bad
Who’s looking shitty? Not me
You think he’s listening? Probably
Mouthpiece on Sally’s like San Joaquin valley
Fuck your middle man, throw that towel in, you irk me
Yeah, yeah, go tell a friend
You’re irrelevant, ain’t shit but a skank
Skank way too far from her holding tank
Come on, girl, get your front on, girl
You rank A-list or so I hear
But no basic here, no safe bets here
Wouldn’t touch a fake bitch with latex here

She's so, she's so
She know we know
She's...

She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro

Party full of thirsty, lurkers hella worried
All in six high glass heels
Cinderella water hole climbing for a pot of goldie
Flip you for a twenty bill
Aim for El Dorado estimated arrival
Time it take a fuck to make a deal
Ain’t gonna make it though, try your luck in porn
You’re so thirsty, all you’ll ever earn is frills

Check two skeeze
Pop that pussy pitch into a tent
How those poles make you so bent
Push that cart peddles you ring the bell
Ring the bell though, hands full of dick
Use your elbows, door to door you sand every last floor
Deep as you can choke a quicksand storm
Lipstick lap dance won’t record

She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
She’s so, she’s so
Beat thirsty, thought I heard a mosquito
She know we know
But her vox so desert and our beats so dro
