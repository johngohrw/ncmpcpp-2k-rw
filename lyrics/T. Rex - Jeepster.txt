You're so sweet
You're so fine
I want you all and everything
Just to be mine

'Cos you're my baby
'Cos you're my love
Girl I'm just a Jeepster
For you love

You slide so good
With bones so fair
You've got the universe
Reclining in your hair

Just like a car
You're pleasing to behold
I'll call you Jaguar
If I may be so bold

The wild winds blow
Upon your frozen cheeks
The way you flip your hip
It always makes me weak

Your motivation
Is so sweet
Your vibrations
Are burning up my feet

Girl I'm just a jeepster
For your love
Girl I'm just a vampire
For your love

I'm gonna suck you.
