Oh, razorblade, that's what I call love
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it
If I put it down, it gets extremely complicated
Anything to forget everything

You've got to take me out at least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now but in your heart it's loud

Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry, let it go

Oh, the razorblade, wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hands or it's at your throat
At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything

He would never talk but he was not shy
She was a street smart girl but she could not lie
They were perfect for each other, say it now
'Cause in your heart it's loud

Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry, hey

Sweetheart, your feelings are more important of course, of course
Everyone that wanted everything that we would take from them
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna know, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
No, don't, okay
