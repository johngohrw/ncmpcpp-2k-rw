Every time I see her, her
Walking down the street
I'm wondering who she's going to meet

Often from a distance
Always so discreet
Keeping prowlers pace
Through the dirty sneaker squeak

But lemme tell ya
I feel a certain way
I feel a certain way

And if she ever
If she ever came this way
If she ever came this way

Every time I see her
My heart beats on display
And the graffiti melts away

The fluorescent hour
Never gave a wink of sleep
For the one who's huffing vapors
From a love they'll never keep

But lemme tell ya
I feel a certain way
I feel a certain way

But wait a second
Her she comes this way
Her she comes this way
