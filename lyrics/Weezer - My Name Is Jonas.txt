My name is Jonas
I'm carrying the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us
But this is how we feel
Come sit next to me
Pour yourself some tea
Just like grandma made
When we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then
Once but never again
We've all left the den
Let me tell you 'bout it 

The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket costs only your mind
The driver said, 'Hey man, we go all the way'
Of course we were willing to pay 

My name is Wepeel
I gotta box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still makin' noise (makin' noise)
Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else?
Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother 

The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math 

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah! 

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
