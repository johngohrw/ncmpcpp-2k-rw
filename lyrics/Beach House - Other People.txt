So you thought it would happen
Good love goodbye
I know where no one can reach you
No I don’t mind
It’s your world why would you fake it
These days go by
As you turn around

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and it's not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Heaven won't keep us together
Right place at the wrong time
It takes all kinds of weather
Distant new skies
Somewhere no one can reach us
These days go by
As you turn around

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and it's not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
Was it ever quite enough
