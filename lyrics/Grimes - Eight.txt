It's always something
It's always something

I know you're runnin' and we know
This town

Go where you want to go
When you get there you'll be wishing you were back home
Oh, go where you want to go
Because its got me
And I can't stop

You want to find
Singing for you softly

Go where you want to go
When you get there you'll be wishing you were back home
Oh, go where you want to go
Because its got me thinking
And I can't stop
