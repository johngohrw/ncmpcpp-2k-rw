(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
(Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Pink flamingos always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me

I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
(Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

I, I see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
(Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(Blue Ribbons on ice)
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys
(Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah

Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
