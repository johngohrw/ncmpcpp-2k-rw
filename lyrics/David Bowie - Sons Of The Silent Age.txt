Sons of the silent age
Stand on platforms
blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows 
of city limits
Lay in bed coming
and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms
like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two 
then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

[CHORUS]
Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's find another way down
(sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
I can't stand another sound
Let's take another way in 
(sons of sound and sons of sound)

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy 
and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars 
and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once 
but dream and dream
They don't walk, 
they just glide in and out of life
They never die, 
they just go to sleep one day

[CHORUS]

(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
Baby, baby, baby, fire away!
