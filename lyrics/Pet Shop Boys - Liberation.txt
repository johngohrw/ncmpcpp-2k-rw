Take my hand,
I've changed my mind again
Really, I believed it true
That all who fell in love were foolish
But I was wrong,
I've learned that lesson well
All the way back home at midnight
You were sleeping on my shoulder

Take my hand,
Don't think of obligations
Now, right now,
Your love is liberation 

To free in me
The trust, I never dared
I always thought the risk too great
But suddenly, I don't hesitate, so

Take my hand,
Don't think of complications
Now, right now,
Your love is liberation
Liberation

Ta ra ra ra ra ra
Ta ra ra ra ra ra

The night, the stars
Our light shone through the dark
All the way back home at midnight
You were sleeping on my shoulder

Take my hand,
Don't think of hesitation
Now, right now,
Your love is liberation
Liberation

Ta ra ra ra ra ra
Ta ra ra ra ra ra

Ta ra ra ra ra ra

Back home at midnight
All the way back home at midnight
