You know that it would be untrue 
You know that I would be a liar 
If I was to say to you 
Girl, we couldn't get much higher 

Come on baby, light my fire 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Try to set the night on fire 

The time to hesitate is through 
No time to wallow in the mire 
Try now we can only lose 
And our love become a funeral pyre 

Come on baby, light my fire 
Come on baby, light my fire 
Try to set the night on fire, yeah
