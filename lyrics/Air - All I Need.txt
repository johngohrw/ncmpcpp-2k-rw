All I need is a little time
To get behind this sun
And cast my weight
All I need is a peace of this mind
Then I can celebrate

All in all there's something to give
All in all there's something to do
All in all there's something to live
With you

All I need is a little sign
To get behind this sun
And cast this weight of mine
All I need is the place to find
And there I'll celebrate

All in all there's something to give
All in all there's something to do
All in all there's something to live
With you, with you

All I need
