Caressing the marble and stone
Love that was special for one
The waste and the fever and hate
How I wish you were here with me now
 
The body that kills and hides
Matches an awful delight
Warm like a dog `round your feet
How I wish you were here with me now
 
The hangman looks `round as he waits
Gullet stretches tight and it breaks
Someday we will die in your dreams
How I wish we were here with you now
