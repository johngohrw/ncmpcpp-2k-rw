My friend
Sits at the drum
His magic hand
Feels nothing but
Time
Nothing but time

My old friend
Sits at the drum
His magic mind
Doesn't feel anything
American Flag is behind
If I could stand
To be less difficult

My new friend
Plays drums all the time 
Her magic heart
Feels everything
She plays the difficult parts and I play
Difficult

She goes shoop shoop eh doop shoop eh doop
Shoop eh doop eh doop eh doop
We go shoop shoop eh doop shoop eh doop shoop eh
Doop eh doop

If I could stand
To be less difficult
