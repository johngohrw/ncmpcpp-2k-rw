Wake up you sleepy head 
Put on some clothes,
shake up your bed 
Put another log on the fire for me 
I've made some breakfast and coffee 
Look out my window and what do I see 
A crack in the sky 
and a hand reaching down to me 
All the nightmares came today 
And it looks as though they're
here to stay 
What are we coming to 
No room for me,
no fun for you 
I think about a world to come 
Where the books were found 
by the Golden ones 
Written in pain, written in awe 
By a puzzled man who questioned 
What we were here for 
All the strangers came today 
And it looks as though
they're here to stay 

[CHORUS:]
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Let me make it plain
([second time:] Let me say it again)
You gotta make way 
for the Homo Superior 

Look at your children 
See their faces in golden rays 
Don't kid yourself they belong to you 
They're the start of a coming race 
The earth is a bitch 
We've finished our news 
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use 
All the strangers came today 
And it looks as though they're here to stay 

[CHORUS]
