Oh, Mr. Gallo, what a good friend 
He's always been a name (?) 
Oh, Mr. Gallo, what a good friend 
Closer I've ever had 
Oh, Chan, what a woman you've become 
Can't say I'd ever thought that he'd look you in the eyes 
Oh, and what a lover you've become 
Can't say that I always thought you were a liar 
Oh, you say 
What a laugh you had 
I cannot say I ever thought I would have had anything funny 
Oh, and what a charmer you've become Mr. Gallo
Not full of hate
