Lean love
All you give to me
Is lean love
I'm like a beggar in the sand
With the sky in his hand
And I'm blue

Black day
All you give to me
Are your wild ways
When you're the love of my life
And when you gorge me with a knife
And I'm blue

Lightening
All the heavy world
Is frightening
I'm like a child in the sand
On the beach of the land of you
And I'm blue
