In the dead of the night I start to lose control
But I still carry the weight like I've always done before
It gets so heavy at times but what more can I do
I got to stay on track just like pops told me to

I really don't think you know
There could be hell below, below
I really do hope you know
There could be hell below, below

When the music is done and all the lights are low
I will remember the times when love would really glow
I could dream ahead before my world turn blue
And the light inside would only shine for you

I really don't think you know
There could be hell below, below
I really do hope you know
There could be hell below, below

I really don't think you know
There could be hell below, below
I really do hope you know
There could be hell below, below
