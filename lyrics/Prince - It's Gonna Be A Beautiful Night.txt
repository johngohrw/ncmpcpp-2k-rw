Everybody get way down,
Tonight we're gonna ball
Tonight we're gonna get the bomb, y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout the Detroit crawl

Everybody in the west
Everybody in the east
[Every man I'll injure]
With my chicken grease
Get with it

(are you ready Paris - Soul Clap)
(ah yeah, ah yeah)

(gimme the bass, gimme the bass, one time)

Said the table 2 the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chillblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair (can't nobody)

Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able! (fuck with us)
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!" (can't nobody)
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try (fuck with us)
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?" (say, can't nobody)

So they both went showly down (fuck with us)
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound (can't nobody)
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side (fuck with us)
"See the table and the chair
Have come 2 take the air!" (y'all - say it y'all)

But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
Till, to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house.

When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother! (can't nobody fuck with us)
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little browny- (say it, y'all)
mousey and the beetle dined,
And danced upon the heads
Till they toddled to their beds. (can't nobody fuck with us)
Good God [repeated in the background]
