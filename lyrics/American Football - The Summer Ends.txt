Thinking about leaving
How I should say goodbye
With a handshake or an embrace
Or a kiss on the cheek, possibly all three

Well, maybe I've been wrong
Maybe my intentions are irrelevant
But honestly, it's not just for me

We've both been so unhappy
So let's just see what happens
When the summer ends
