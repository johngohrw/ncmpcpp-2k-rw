I thought I was smart, I thought I was right
I thought it better not to fight
I thought there was a virtue in always being cool
So when it came time to fight,
I thought I'll just step aside and that the time would prove you wrong
And that you would be the fool

I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins,
It's all a mystery

Oh to fight is to defend if it's not now than tell me when
Would be the time that you would stand up and be a man
For to lose I could accept, but to surrender I just wept and regretted this moment
Oh that I, I was the fool

I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins,
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life,
It's all a mystery

Cause I'm a man not a boy and there are things you can't avoid,
You have to face them when you're not prepared to face them
If I could, I would, but you're with him now it'd do no good
I should have fought him but instead I let him-
I let him take it

I don't know where the sun beams end and the star light begins,
It's all a mystery
And I don't know how a man decides what right for his own life
It's all a mystery
