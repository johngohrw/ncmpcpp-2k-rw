Don't you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Baby, now my head is on backwards
And my feet at funny angles
And every time I take a step
We're moving forwards faster
And lately, I can't take it

Baby, now my body's in tatters
In an ordinary fashion
And everything I tried to leave behind
Is still beside us
But lately I can't take it

Leftover breakfast, cereal for lunch
She is broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar when she's gettin' blazed

Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Lazy, and lyin' on your belly
With a super pump cola
Lookin' at your folded clothes
You've worn for three days over
With a cookie as a coaster

Maybe, I wish I could mold ya
"The Very Cold and Colder"
But you couldn't step forward
So it hurts to say it's hopeless
And we ain't gonna make it

Leftover breakfast, cereal for lunch
She's broken but she's fun
My girl eats mayonnaise
From a jar when she's gettin' blazed

She's drunk on old cartoons
Liquid TV afternoons
Sometimes it makes me laugh
Sometimes it makes me sad

Don't you need me
Oh baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise

Oh baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby, now my head is on backwards
Oh baby, now my head is on backwards
Mmm baby, now my head is on backwards

Don't you need me
Oh, baby boy
Cause I'm so happy
Without your noise
