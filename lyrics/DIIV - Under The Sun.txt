Yes, I'll come back to you
No, I won't ask where you run
Under the sun

Yes, I'll catch up to you
Then I'll ask, "what have we done?"
Under the sun

To be free, be awake
Big breath that you can’t fake
Once you’ve begun

Press my face to the back
All the pillars that stack
And hold up the sun

On the right side coming on the right time
On the right time coming on the right side
