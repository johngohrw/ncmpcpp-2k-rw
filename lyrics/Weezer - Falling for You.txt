Holy cow! I think I've got one here
Now just what am I supposed to do?
I've got a number of irrational fears
That I'd like to share with you
First, there's rules about old goats like me
Hanging around with chicks like you
But I do like you and another one: 
You say 'like' too much

But I'm shaking at your touch
I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
And I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you 

Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?
Just as I was busting loose
I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat and old with you
Cos I'm a burning a candle you're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
And I do like you - you're the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one 

I'm shaking at your touch
I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
And I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you 

Holy sweet goddamn! You left your cello in the basement
I admired the glowing the stars
And tried to play a tune
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true
What could you possibly see in little ol' 3 chord me?
But I do like you and you like me too
I'm ready, let's do it baby 

I'm shaking at your touch
I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
And I'd do about anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you
