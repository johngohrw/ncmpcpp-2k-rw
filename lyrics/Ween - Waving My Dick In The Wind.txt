I'm waving my dick in the wind
waving my dick in the wind
if it all goes right, I'll be in your arms tonight
but I'm wavin' my dick in the wind

I'm lost in the sauce once again
I'm lost in the sauce once again
If I make it through the night
everything will be alright
but I'm lost in the sauce once again

Its been 97 days since i've laid my head beside you
and a million miles of highway in between
there's some red and blue lights that are shinin' right behind me
and that pig's a pretty mean bastard

You should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance
you should have seen old Jimmy Wilson dance
give that boy a dime and you could have a chance
to see old Jimmy Wilson dance
dance Jimmy...

I've got a real good feelin bout' old Jimmy Wilson
sho' nuff' he's got what it takes
do another number for me please won't ya Jimmy
cause you're a really good dancer...

Im wavin my dick in the wind....
