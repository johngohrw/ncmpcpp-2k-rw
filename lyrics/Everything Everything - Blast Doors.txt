You can tell the past, boy, I can tell the future
Give me a lobotomy and I can be your tutor
Open up the blast doors, then we can be neutered
I can smell your fingerprints all over my computer

So give me all the black brown sticky sugar water
Swing you by your neck, mama, this can be your future
Something very strange about your picture in the mirror
When you move, it doesn't move - now how could that be weirder?

Just keep on rubbernecking, yeah, whatever feels familiar
I can send my brain on holiday forever
You can fire a rocket at a rocket, it's the future
If you were already dead, I wouldn't have to school you

You say you're gonna change
But you don't have any time

[Chorus x2:]
Down in my beast heart
I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind I
Open my wild eye

Go tell it to the plain clothed officer stood behind us
What are you, a master of disguise and keeping silent?
Drop another depth charge, coiling like a viper
Eyes so close together make it harder for the sniper

Shoot a starving porno for the yuppies in a circle
Second death upon you swimming backwards like a turtle
Man, I really trusted you; I thought you were civilian
I can shove a magnet in your mouth and make a million

So did you pack your bag or did somebody pack it for you?
Take me to the sad sad party that you're bound to
Whether you're a have not or a have I got a question
Are you living dead or is this some kind of possession?

You say you're gonna change
But you don't have any time

[Chorus x4:]
Down in my beast heart
I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind I
Open my wild eye

You say you're gonna change
But you don't have any time
You say you're gonna change
But you don't have any time

[Chorus x5:]
Down in my beast heart
I build an empire
Whenever I'm blind I
Open my wild eye
