Grandpop we had sweet days on the beach in Ventnor I remember
Wish we could walk along and you could watch the waves and talk the current Septembers

These days I’m not so sure who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn’t there when Moses parted the sea I wasn’t there with you grandpop back in Kiev

With the ladies dressed so nice in their ornate reds with satin textures
Have you since found some peace it seems I can’t escape all the war and violence

These days I’m not so sure who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn’t there when Moses parted the sea I wasn’t there with you grandpop back in Kiev

Lets just speak love

Bagels for everyone that’s the kind of thing you would have wanted there
should be lots to eat or how can they expect to get a tiring job done?

These days I’m not so sure who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn’t there when Moses parted the sea I wasn’t there with you grandpop back in Kiev
