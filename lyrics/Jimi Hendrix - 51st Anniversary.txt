51st anniversary

A fifty years they've been married
And they can't wait for their fifty first to roll around
Yeah, roll around
A thirty years they've been married
And now they're old and happy and they settle down
Settle down yeah!
Twenty years they've been married
And they did everything that could be done
You know their havin' fun

And then you come along and talk about

So you say you wanna be married
I'm gonna change your mind
Oh got to change
That was the good side baby
Here comes the bad side

Ten years they've been married
And a thousand kids run around hungry
Cause ther mother's a louse
Daddy's down at the wihiskey house
That ain't all

For thirty years they've been married
They don't get along so good
They're tired of each other, you know how that goes
She got another lover
Huh same old thing

So now you're seventeen
Running around hanging out, and a havin' your fun
Life for you has just begun, baby

And then you come saying
So you, you say you wanna get married
Oh baby trying to put me on a chain
Aint that some shame
You must be losing your, sweet little mind
I ain't ready yet, baby, I ain't ready
I'm gonna change your mind

Oooh look out baby
Oh
I ain't ready
I ain't ready
I ain't ready

Let me live
Let me live
Let me live a little longer
