So you think thereâ€™s no meaning
In anything that we do?
Maybe it's the silence
Maybe it's the war

Try to understand it
Try your best to understand the world
You're bleeding down the highway
You just want to listen to the roar

Well, you called him a liar
And you called him a piece of dirt
Never can you take it back and
Never can you make it right

In the final second
I think he knew everything you are
A plague on the horizon
In the cold arena where you're...

Trapped
In the moment you met
In the lifetime I'm there
But she still doesn't love you
But you didn't know why
You can take it from there
There's a light in your eyes
That's the thing you would always say
That it is no worse

And they called you a witness
And they called you the next-of-kin
Maybe you don't hear their questions
Or you don't want to take it in

No one saw it coming
Nobody could see the underside
He was straighter than an arrow
Pointed at a target in his mind

And his bow was his anger
But his blade was this cursed time
He didn't want to be your prisoner
Anymore than you'd be mine

Try to know the difference
Sleep until your feelings lift away
I'll be waiting for you
A reservoir between us, as you're...

Trapped
In the moment you met
In the lifetime I'm there
But she still doesn't love you
But you didn't know why
You can take it from there
There's a light in your eyes
That's the thing you would always say
That it is no worse

Yes
It's the back of your mind
It's the heart of a gun
It's the thought that you might have done it
But you can't know why
Don't you waste any love
There's a truth in the blood
There's a thing he was always saying
That it is no worse
