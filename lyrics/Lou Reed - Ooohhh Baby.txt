You're the kind of girl that
everybody's warned me about
You're the kind of person that
everybody's here staring at
But now you are a topless dancer
working out of a bar on Times Spuare
And everybody wishes you were back down in some corner
only Baby know, you make me go

Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh

Your old man was the best P and E man
down on the streets
And all the guy in the precinct
always was watching for him on the beat
But when he ripped off Seymour
he was really not a doing so fine
And everything is knots, well except -
- his hands and legs and maybe even mime
he see they just make them strip off, they say

Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
ooohhh baby, ooohhh
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
hey, baby, ooohhh-ooohhh

It's very funny asking me
why they keep the lights on down so low
Well, yesterday's chase's today's competition
or didn't you know
And all the fluorescent lighting make so your wrinkles
they don't show
And it's very funny the way that
20 bucks an hour cannot go
if you don't make 'em go, now, now, now

Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
ooohhh baby, ooohhh
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh

Everybody wondered 'bout you when you was seen
in drinking some beer
You got here from Ohio and your mother said
you hooked her in the real near
that's the way it goes now

Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh
hey, shake your bones now, mama
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ah
hey, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
walk it, now

(Ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh) Get down
(ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
(Ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
(ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
(Ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
(ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
(Ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
(ooohhh baby, ooohhh, ooohhh baby, ooohhh)
