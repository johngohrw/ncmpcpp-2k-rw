I tried taking a picture of you
When I look at it nothing comes through
Sometimes I wonder if you're just a ghost
And I wonder who's haunting you most

I tried describing you to all my friends
But they just told me to polish my lens
You're sweet, generous, my sweetheart
I don't even know where to start

Even Da Vinci couldn't paint you
Stephen Hawking can't explain you
Rosetta Stone could not translate you
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words
I couldn't put it in a novel
I wrote a page, but it was awful
Now I just want to sing your gospel
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words

I looked you up on ancestry.com
There was no record of Dad or of Mom
It's like you fell straight out of the sky
And left the scholars to figure out why

I like to think that I know quite a lot
But with you it feels like I forgot
I wish that I could explain who you are
But when I try to I never get far

Even Da Vinci couldn't paint you
Stephen Hawking can't explain you
Rosetta Stone could not translate you
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words
I couldn't put it in a novel
I wrote a page, but it was awful
Now I just want to sing your gospel
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words

We've come so far, now here we are
We made it through the night
I know we will, be strong, cause still
Everything will be alright

Even Da Vinci couldn't paint you
And Stephen Hawking can't explain you
Rosetta Stone could not translate you
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words
I couldn't put it in a novel
I wrote a page, but it was awful
Now I just want to sing your gospel
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words
I'm at a loss for words, I'm at a loss for words
