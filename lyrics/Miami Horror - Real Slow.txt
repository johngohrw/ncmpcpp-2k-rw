I see the look inside your eyes
We can make it if we try, so come on
So many pictures in your mind
No need to hold them in disguise, so come on

If we could go to another home
If you wanna be in my family
If we could grow, I'll make sure that it was slow
And you will know, I'll make sure that it was slow

Oh, we can take our time now that I know, this time
We can take our time now that I know, this time
Real slow
Real slow
Real slow

So destiny, hanging in the breeze
Is great to see, you're meant for me
If we could grow, I'll make sure that it goes slow
And you will know, I'll make sure that it was slow

Oh, we can take our time now that I know, this time
We can take our time now that I know, this time
Real slow
Real slow
Real slow

Oh, we can take our time now that I know, this time
We can take our time now that I know, this time
Real slow
Real slow
Real slow
