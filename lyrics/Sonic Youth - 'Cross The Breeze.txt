Let's go walking on the water
Come all the way please
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

No need to be scared
Let's jump into the day
I wanna know
I think I oughta go

Close your eyes and make believe
You can do whatever you please
I wanna know
I think I better go

Let's go walkin on water
Now you think I'm Satan's daughter
I wanna know
Please let me go!

Just too quick
Now I think I'm gonna be sick
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

I'm trying for the future
It's funny that way
I wanna know
I wanna know!

I took a look into the hate
It made me feel very up to date
I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

Hold me tight, down on my knees
So I don't go burning 'cross the breeze
I wanna know
I wanna know!

I wanna know
Should I stay or go?

Burning 'cross the breeze
Burning 'cross the breeze
Blowing 'cross the breeze
