My girl's a liar
But I'll stand beside her
She's all I've got
And I don't want to be alone 

My girl don't see me
When she's with my friends
She's all I've got
And I don't want to be alone 

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I can't have any other one
Though I would
Now I never could with one 

All of the drugs she does
Scare me real good
She's got a tattoo
And two pet snakes
Nobody knows me like her
Nobody knows her like me
We're all we've got
And we don't want to be alone 

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I can't have any other one
Though I would
Now I never could with one 

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I won't have any other one
Though I would
Now I never could with one
