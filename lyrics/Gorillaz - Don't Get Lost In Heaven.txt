Got off a plane to the countryside,
I drove to the mountain and holding the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead,
and fire coming out of the monkey's head

[Chorus:]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
you'll make a big mistake

Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line but it wasn't with you
There was more of it there, when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul...
You're a hoe girl
Yeah you're a hoe

[Chorus]

Aaaah...
