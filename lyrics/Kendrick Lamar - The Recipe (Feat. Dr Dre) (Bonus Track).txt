Smoking weed with you...

[Repeats]

[Dr Dre:]
Every morning when I wake up
Uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I'm living but
Really though, it's never enough
10 million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for...

[Hook:]
Women, weed and weather
They come for
Women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the
Women, weed and weather
Women, weed and weather

These niggas'll kill for that
Put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that
Me, I make mills off that
How the fuck ya'll can't see I ride
When I drive, down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes
I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day I guess
For a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby gonna lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

[Hook:]
Women, weed and weather
They come for

[Kendrick Lamar:]
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
3W's only for a three day run
Bitch, take the motherfacking panties off you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breath
I control, California living til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe cause she in the neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy, and for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Vorhees, boy he,
On his job, boy he sure be havin' them marks on they marks
Pretty bitches and tyre marks
Let 'em inhale the pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my price
No way hell no, uh uh
If I'm wrong than I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault that it's 82 degrees
And my top peeled off

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

[Dr Dre:]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees
Double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion
How many ways am I killin' 'em
Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck til the morning
Time and I got time and I know that I'm in a position of controlling anything
I buy that ocean, I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean
Ain't nobody fucking with this

[Kendrick Lamar:]
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean towards 3 W's and life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don't fuck with' no hand me downs
See if you fuck than it's after me
You know how much I'm a make it work?
You know her dress, living in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first
Cali

You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
