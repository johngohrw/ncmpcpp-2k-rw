Mad sounds in your ears make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up

Yeah, they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

Mad sounds in your ears make you get up and dance
Make you get up
All night long reappear
Make you get up and dance

Yeah, they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la la...
(Ooh la la la la...)

You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears make you get up and dance
Well don't they make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up
