(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)

I know it hurts
You know, I'd quench that thirst
(I can treat you better than them)
You say you're lonely
I say you'll think about it
'Cause you're the only
One who resonates that chase
Mouth open like (Aahh)

(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)
(Mouth open your high)
Flying like a screamin' falcon,
Only way to do each other
(Mouth open your heart)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognize her
Mouth open, you're high

I know it hurts
You know, I'd put you first
(I can fuck you better than her)
You say you want me
I say you'll live without it
Unless you're the only
One who instigates
Got your mouth, open your high

(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)
(Mouth open your heart)
Flying like a screamin' falcon,
Only ways to do each other
(Mouth open your heart)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognize her
Mouth open, you're high

Feel your body closin', I can rip it open
Suck me up, I'm healin' for the shit you're dealin'
Smoke on the skin to get those pretty eyes rollin'
My thighs are apart for when you're ready to breathe in
Suck me up, I'm healin' for the shit you're dealin'
High, motherfucker, got your mouth open, you know you're mine

I'd put you first
Just close your eyes and dream about it
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)
I'll quench your thirst
Just chase a lie and stop your doubtin'
Flying like a screamin' falcon
Only ways to do each other
(High, high, high, high)
(Higher than a motherfucker, dreamin' of you, as my lover)
Flying like a screamin' falcon,
Only ways to do each other
(Mouth open you're high)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognize her
Mouth open, you're high
