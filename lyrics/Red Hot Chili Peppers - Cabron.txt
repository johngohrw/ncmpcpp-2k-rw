I see you in the park
You're always wearing Dodger blue
Mad-doggin me and anyone from any other crew
I am small but I am strong
I'll get it on with you
If you want me to
What else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue from anything you do
If you want them to
What else can they do?
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news

I come around and make peace get down have a barbecue
Let's keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo
I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would take a cue from anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news

I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's for singing songs about the local news
