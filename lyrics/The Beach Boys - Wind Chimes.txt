Hangin' down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
Wind chimes
Wind chimes

In the late afternoon you're
Hung up on wind chimes
Wind chimes
Wind chimes

Though it's hard I try
Not to look at my wind chimes
Wind chimes
Wind chimes

Now and then a tear rolls on my cheek

On a warm breeze the little bells
Tinklin' wind chimes
Wind chimes
Wind chimes

Close your eyes and lean back
Listen to wind chimes
Wind chimes
Wind chimes

It's so peaceful
Close to a lullabye

The wind chimes tinglin'
Tinglin'
Tinglin'
Tinglin'
The wind chimes tinglin'
Tinglin'
Tinglin'
Tinglin'
Da do do da do do da do do da do do

Whisperin' winds send my wind chimes a tinklin'
Whisperin' winds send my wind chimes a tinklin'
Whisperin' winds send my wind chimes a tinklin'
Whisperin' winds send my wind chimes a tinklin'
