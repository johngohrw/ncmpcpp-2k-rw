We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do…

These times you get
Rain or shine or stormy weather,
This thing we do…

With world-weary grace
We’ve taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name

Or stay home by the fire
Failed by desire
Stoking the flames
But we’re here for the ride

Its Louder than words this thing that we do
Louder than words – the way it unfurls
Its louder than words – the sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts is louder than words
Louder than words

The strings bend and slide as the hours fly by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues, gonna tap out the rhythm

Let’s go with the flow
Wherever it goes
We’re more than alive

Its Louder than words this thing that we do
Louder than words – the way it unfurls
Its louder than words – the sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts is louder than words
Louder than words – this thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse louder than words
Louder than words
