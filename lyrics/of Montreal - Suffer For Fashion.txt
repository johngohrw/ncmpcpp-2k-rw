We just want to emote until we're dead
I know we suffer for fashion or whatever
We don't want these days to ever end
We just want to emasculate them forever

Pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
Not like that

We've got to keep it physical
When our tellies are six hours away
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever
Vicissitudes are boxing our heads
Like they just want to emaciate them forever
Forever
Forever

Pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
Not like that

We've got to keep our little click clicking at 130 BPM
It's not too slow
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together
Together
Let's go together
Let's do it together
Let's go together

...Focus... (...calling...)
...What's the status? (eleven)...

Forever
Forever
Pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
Not like that

We've got to keep our little click clicking at 130 BPM
It's not too slow
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together
Together
Let's go together
Let's do it together
Let's go together
