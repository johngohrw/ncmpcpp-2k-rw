Not guilty
For getting in your way
While you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest
I'm not trying to steal your vest.

I am not trying to be smart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your ageing head
But like you heard me said
Not guilty.

Not guilty
For being on your street
Getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ
While I'm trying to do my bit.

I don't expect to take your heart . . .
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed . . .
But like you heard me said . . .
Not guilty.

Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay.

I won't upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been misled . . .
But like you heard me said . . .
Not guilty.
