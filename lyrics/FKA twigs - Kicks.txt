When I'm low (Low, low)
I feel for you (You, you)
Time passes by (By, by, by)
Feel it for you

I explore
Stroke my side
Yes, I do
Feel for you

So, I tell myself it's cool for me to wait for you, just for you
I collect my thoughts and breathe
Because I take your lead
Take your lead

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here?
What do I do when you're not here?

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here?
What do I do when you're not here?
I get my kicks like you

When I'm alone (Lone, lone)
I don't need you (You, you)
I love my touch
Know just what to do

So, I tell myself it's cool to get my kicks like you, just like you
I just touch myself and say
"I'll make my own damn way"
Own damn way

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here?
Tell me, what do I do?
Baby, it's clear

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)

(When you're not here)

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
I get my kicks like you

(When you're not here)

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)

(When you're not here)

Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
I get my kicks like you

What do I do when you're not here?
I get my kicks like...

I get my kicks like you
Tell me what do I do?
Baby, it's clear
