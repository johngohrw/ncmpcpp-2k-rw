I can hear - voices in the water 
Coming up like - smoke brings the wind 
I have to take some time - to relocate that house of mine 
I think I must of lost it in the river 
They see things so different 
To green eyes they give nothing away 
Do you think now at last 
You can tell me 
No you won't - give it away 
Crush snow on my face 
Feels like burning 
And the birds blackface singing in the tree 
If I got myself a gun 
Then I could shoot down every one 
Maybe I've just invented some religion 
I saw father dancing with his daughter 
And the music singing softly on the breeze 
I can't see an end - salvation anywhere 
Think I'll wait here till the cows come down the river 
Think I'll wait here till the cows come down the river 
you've heard all this before 
Already I know 
A lost soul - I won't say anymore
