He was leading us through the dark
He was saying that love goes on
I was wanting some ice cream
He knew exactly what I meant

From the driver's seat in the dark
He popped a tape in the dash of his car
And when the singer started to scream
I knew exactly what he meant

I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was
What a sensible man he was
What a wonderful man he was

I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was
What a sensuous man he was
What a wonderful man he was

Why do we love what is wrong?
Big devil told us to sing along
And like a loving flock we obey
Except for him he went his own way

I never knew for sure
What a wonderful man he was
Till the day I found out his cause
Was to do it for all of us
