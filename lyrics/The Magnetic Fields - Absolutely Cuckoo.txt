Absolutely CuckooThe Magnetic FieldsDon't fall in love with me yetWe only recently metTrue, I'm in love with you, butYou might decide I'm a nutGive me a week or two toGo absolutely cuckooAnd when you see your errorThen you can flee in terrorLike everybody else doesI only tell you this 'causeI'm easy to get rid ofBut not if you fall in loveKnow now that I'm on the makeAnd if you make a mistakeMy heart will certainly breakI'll have to jump in a lakeAnd all my friends will blame youThere's no telling what they'll doIt's only fair to tell youI'm absolutely cuckooDon't fall in love with me yetWe only recently metTrue, I'm in love with you, butYou might decide I'm a nutGive me a week or two toGo absolutely cuckooAnd when you see your errorThen you can flee in terrorLike everybody else doesI only tell you this 'causeI'm easy to get rid ofBut not if you fall in loveKnow now that I'm on the makeAnd if you make a mistakeMy heart will certainly breakI'll have to jump in a lakeAnd all my friends will blame youThere's no telling what they'll doIt's only fair to tell youI'm absolutely cuckooIt's only fair to tell youI'm absolutely cuckoo[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Absolutely_Cuckoo ]
