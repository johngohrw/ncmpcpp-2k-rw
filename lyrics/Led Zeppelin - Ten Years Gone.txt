Then as it was, then again it will be 
An' though the course may change sometimes 
Rivers always reach the sea 
Blind stars of fortune, each have several rays 
On the wings of maybe, down in birds of prey 
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow 
But as the eagle leaves the nest, it's got so far to go 

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me 
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be 

Did you ever really need somebody, And really need 'em bad 
Did you ever really want somebody, The best love you ever had 
Do you ever remember me, baby, did it feel so good 
'Cause it was just the first time, And you knew you would 

Through the eyes an' I sparkle, Senses growing keen 
Taste your love along the way, See your feathers preen 
Kind of makes makes me feel sometimes, Didn't have to grow 
We are eagles of one nest, The nest is in our soul 

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me 
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be 
Oh darlin', oh darlin' 

I'm never gonna leave you. I never gonna leave 
Holdin' on, ten years gone 
Ten years gone, holdin' on, ten years gone
