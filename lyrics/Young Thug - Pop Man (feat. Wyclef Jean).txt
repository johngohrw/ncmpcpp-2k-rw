Jeffery be easy
After sex she gon' wanna get married
Seen many men on Maury
Claimin' the kid not my baby
But taste the cake
I gotta have a shower to the big red sofa chair
Play truth or dare
Jumpin' in the pool with no swim wear gear
Kept me weird lookin' like a peacock
Everytime we press (?) we won't stop
Feelin' like the b block time shift
Number one hits, she in love with the voodoo sex
Flippin' on the mat yo
Like olympians in Rio, oh
Blast off like the rocket man
Piano scream so loud, dolphins hear the signal
