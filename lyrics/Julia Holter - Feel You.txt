My first thought was there are
So many days of rain in Mexico City 
A good reason to go
You know I love to run away from sun

Is it time to dance? I'll fall 
You know I like to fall, I'm hopeful for
The rush hour car stares and
The memory of your piano

Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

The time change worked well
I had a good excuse for being late
But I pushed open the door -
The room was empty of all the people gone

When the cab pulled up I laughed
I forgot where I was going
There I stood mystified
I could give no reason for my frozen stare

Am I heading toward you?
It's a hot day
Can I feel you?
Are you mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

All these perfumes
In this parking lot
Thousands of people pass through
On the festival day
Playing their saxophones
I see a flashing light
I'm blinded by the possibility

It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat
