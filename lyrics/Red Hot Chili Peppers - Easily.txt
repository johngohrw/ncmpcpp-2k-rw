Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
Shao Lin shouted a rose
From his throat
Everything must go
A lickin' stick is thicker
When you break it to show
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're
fighting for

Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake
Of his soul - Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the things that you own
Everything must go

I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over
But it's only on the rise
Calling calling
For something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're
fighting for

Throw me to the wolves because
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back

Shao Lin shakin' for the sake
Of his soul - Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of
All the things that you own
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're
fighting for

Calling calling for something in the air
Calling calling I know you must be there

I don't want to be your little research monkey
boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy

Throw me to the wolves
Because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky
Because I know I'm coming back
