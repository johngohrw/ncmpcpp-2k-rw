Seven years of hard luck, comin' down on me 
From the Florida border, yea up to Nashville Tennessee 
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honkytonk 
Along come Mr Yankee Slicker, sayin' maybe you're what I want 

[Chorus]
Want you to sign your contract 
Want you to sign today 
Gonna give you lots of money 
Workin' For MCA

9000 dollars, that's all we could win 
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin 
They're gonna take me out to California gonna make me a superstar 
Just pay me all of my money and mister maybe you won't get a scar

[Chorus]

Suckers took my money since I was seventeen 
If it ain't no pencil pusher, it got to be a honkytonk queen 
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I wan't you people to know 
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes

[Chorus]
