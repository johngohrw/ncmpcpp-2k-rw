My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
Stand in your door 
When we meet inside 
Show me some more 
Show me some more 
Show me some more 

My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
Turn and stare 
Fix your hair 
Move upstairs 
Move upstairs 
Move upstairs 

My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
Free from disguise 
Gazing on a city under 
Television skies 
Television skies 
Television skies 

My eyes have seen you 
My eyes have seen you 
Eyes have seen you 
Let them photograph your soul 
Memorize your alleys 
On an endless roll 
Endless roll [x 15]
