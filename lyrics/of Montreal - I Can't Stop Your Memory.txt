I can't stop your memory from breaking my heart. 
Devils were laughing so loud,
I couldn't hear the radio. 

In the dark bags become, 
Sneaking devils waiting to pounce 
And display impressive claws. 
I might wink at them before they land. 

I can hear my heart beat
across the room behind the closet door 

When I'm laying in my bed in the dark. 
I can't gather all the love I need when I need it. 
I'm not mad I understand that that's the price, 
And all is forgiven in the end 
If your heart was in the right place. 
If you lived an honest life, if you tried 

I can't stop your memory from breaking my heart 
Devils were laughing so loud,
I couldn't hear the radio.
