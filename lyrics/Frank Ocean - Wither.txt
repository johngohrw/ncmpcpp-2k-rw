Oh where the trees burn down
Place where the fields went down in flames
You could put a hole in the ground
Oh, seasons dance for rain
It takes a mind to wander
Conscience to feel ashamed
There's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with pain
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
Girl tonight I hold you close, close enough to prove
Hope a garden grows where we dance this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring and flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (flowers)
See me wither
Oh and I hope
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine
(You know it happens all...)
Know that I've enjoyed the sunshine...
Know it happens all... all the time
Be, be, be
You know it happens all... all the time
All the time
Be, be, be
I'm gone
Be, be, be, be
