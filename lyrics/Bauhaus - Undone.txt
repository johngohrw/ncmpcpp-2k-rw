Undone you say
As if a sorry thing
If there was an undoing
Of you to be

What cause to bring
An opening heart
A craven soulless ring
A valencian bell

No passing of the lote tree

Undone and away with you
You long road wither flaunt
Your pearls bouncing plasticine
A knowledge ever to haunt

No passing of the lote tree
