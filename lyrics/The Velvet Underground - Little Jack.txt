I was raised in better days, mostly by myself
No-one ever took the time or was inclined to help
Mother dear, she was never near, she left me to the street
A little boy who was not too tall, with dirty hands and feet
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; Susie keep away
Though my life was lily-white, was all I heard them say
Hey hey
Now I'm grown, I'm on my own, running free and wild
Not inclined to be entwined with a Mrs and a child
Though my dear it may seem queer, it keeps me in the black
Should you depart to break my heart, don't bother looking back
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; Susie keep away
Though my life was lily-white, it's all I heard them say
Hey hey... get in!
Now I'm grown, I'm on my own, running free and wild
Not inclined to be entwined with a Mrs and a child
Though my dear it may seem queer, it keeps me in the black
Should you depart to break my heart, don't bother looking back
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; Susie keep away
Though my life was lily-white, was all I heard them say
Hey hey... oh!
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; Susie keep away
Though my life was lily-white, was all I heard them say
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; Susie keep away
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; was all I heard them say
Oh... Little Old Jack, you best stay back; Susie keep away
Little Old Jack, you best stay back; was all I heard them say
