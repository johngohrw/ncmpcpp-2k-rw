Like a restless leaf in the autumn breeze 
Once I was a tumblin' weed 
Like a rollin' stone, cold and all alone 
Living for the day my train would come 
I never cared for school or any golden rules 
Papa used to always say I was a useless fool 
So I left my home to show them thay was wrong 
And headed out on the road singing my song 
Then one sunny day. The man, he looked my way 
And everything that I dreamed of, it was real 
Money, girls and cars; and big long cigars 
And I caught the first plane home so papa would see

When I went home to show 'em they was wrong 
All that I found was two tombstones 
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong 
Oh, such a sad song 
First I got lost, then I got found 
But the ones that I love are in the ground 
Papa I only wish you could see me now 
Take a listen papa 
Whoo, I learnt how to play my guitar 
Gonna be a superstar

First I got lost, then I got found 
The ones I love are in the ground 
Won't you tell me please was I right or wrong

If there's any way you can hear what I say 
Papa, I never meant to do you wrong 
All the money, girls and cars. And all the words and all the cigars 
Papa, I just want you to know they couldn't take your place

When I went home to show 'em they was wrong 
All that I found was two tombstones 
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong 
Oh, such a sad song 
First I got lost, then I got found 
But the ones that I love are in the ground 
Somebody tell me please was I right or wrong
