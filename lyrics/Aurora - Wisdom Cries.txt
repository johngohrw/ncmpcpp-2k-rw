We go way back in time, time
Through diamond eyes
We go running
Way back in time
Through diamond eyes

We gotta go back to the start
Back 'til we are back home
We gotta go back to the start
Back 'til we are back home

Tick-tock, tick-tock
Tick-tock tick
Where is the light
Are we meant to go down again?
We go down

Lightening strikes
Wisdom cries
It's an emergency, emergency
Conscious all night
No one's surprised
As long as we...emergency
Emergency, emergency

Wis-Wisdom cries
Wisdom cries
Wisdom cries
Wisdom cries
Wisdom cries
Wisdom cries
