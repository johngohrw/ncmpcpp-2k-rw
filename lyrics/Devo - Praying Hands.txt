You got your left hand
You got your right hand
You got your left hand
You got your right hand

Well the left hand's diddling 
While the right hand goes to work
I said the left hand's diddling now
While the right hand goes to work

You got both hands
You got both hands 
You got praying hands
You got praying hands
They pray for no man
They pray for no man

OK....Relax... 
And assume the position 
Go into doggie submission

Wash your hands three times a day
Always do what your mom and dad say
Brush your teeth in the following way
Wash your hands three times a day

You got your left hand
You got your right hand
You got your left hand
You got your right hand

Well the left hand's diddling 
While the right hand goes to work
I said the left hand's diddling now
While the right hand goes to work

You got both hands
You got both hands 
You got praying hands
You got praying hands
They pray for no man
They pray for no man

Roll over, play dead
Get spiritual-minded

OK....Relax... 
And assume the position 
Go into doggie submission

Wash your hands three times a day
Always do what your mom and dad say
Brush your teeth in the following way
Wash your hands three times a day
