The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave

I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside

I'd rather go to jail

It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)

That could dream about a thought
That could think about dreaming a dream
Where I can not, where I can not
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
Spin this flammable paper on the film's that my life
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon

(In the dark, in the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for
