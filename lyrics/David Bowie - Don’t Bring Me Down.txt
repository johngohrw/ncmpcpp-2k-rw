I'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think 
this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 
'cause someone new

And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll ?settle down?
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll ?settle down?
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me down
