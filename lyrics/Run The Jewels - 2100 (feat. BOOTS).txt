[Killer Mike:]
How long before the hate that we hold
Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off
It's too clear, nuclear's too near
And the holders of the molotov
Say that "revolution's right here, right now"
And they ain't callin' off

[El-P:]
Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
Love will survive
Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

[Killer Mike:]
Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean off my Kalashnikov
Stop, pow
Ten for a min
Free this case shit, get the poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Then behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, fight, or laugh hard, and live long
That's the anecdote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

[BOOTS:]
Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me home, take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home, take me home

Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

[Killer Mike:]
Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)

[EL-P:]
And I don't how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't ever really seen any right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light
(Beam of the light, beam of the light)

[BOOTS:]
Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me home, take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home, take me home
