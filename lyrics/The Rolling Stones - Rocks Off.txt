I hear you talking when I'm on the street,
Your mouth don't move but I can hear you speak.
What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more,
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?
And I'm always hearing voices on the street,
I want to shout, but I can't hardly speak.
I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine.
I can't seem to stay in step,
'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me.
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming,
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.
I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed.
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed.
Heading for the overload,
Splattered on the dusty road,
Kick me like you've kicked before,
I can't even feel the pain no more.
But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming,
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.
Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene.
Feel so mesmerized all that inside me.
The sunshine bores the daylights out of me.
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery.
Headed for the overload,
Splattered on the dirty road,
Kick me like you've kicked before,
I can't even feel the pain no more.
But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming,
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.
