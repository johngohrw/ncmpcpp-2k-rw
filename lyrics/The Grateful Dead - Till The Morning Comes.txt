Till the morning comes, it'll do you fine.
Till the morning comes, like a highway sign,
Showing you the way, leaving no doubt,
Of the way on in or the way back out.

Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself eeeeeeasy

Till we all fall down, it'll do you fine,
Don't think about what you left behind
The way you came or the way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow

Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself eeeeeeasy

When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow, it'll ease your mind
The shape it takes could be yours to choose,
What you may win, what you may lose

Tell you what I'll do, I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now, make yourself easy, make yourself easy
Make yourself eeeeeeeasy

You're my woman now, make yourself easy.
You're my woman now, make yourself easy.
You're my woman now, make yourself easy.
You're my woman now, make yourself easy.
