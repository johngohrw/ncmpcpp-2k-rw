Oogie waits for just another day 
Drags his bones
to see the Yankees play 
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh, they slip away 

Once a time 
they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen 
No one knew what they could do 
Except for me and you
They slip away 
They slip away 

Don't forget 
to keep your head warm 
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
Watching all the world 
and war torn 
How I wonder where you are 
Oo-o
Sailing over
Coney Island 
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
We were dumb 
but you were fun, boy 
How I wonder where you are 
Oo-o

Oogie knew there's never ever time
Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982 
The joke we always knew 
Oo-oo 
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away 
Oo-o

Don't forget
to keep your head warm
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd 
Watching all the world 
and war torn 
How I wonder where you are
Oo-o
Sailing over 
Coney Island
Twinkle twinkle Uncle Floyd
We were dumb
but you were fun, boy
How I wonder where you are 
Oo-o
Sailing
