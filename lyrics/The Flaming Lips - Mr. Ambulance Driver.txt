Waiting, for the Ambulance to come
Hoping that it doesn't come too late
Hearing the sirens in the distance
Hold on help is on the way.

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
Though I live somehow I frown

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't here anymore
The one that wasn't here anymore
The one that wasn't here anymore

Oh we can't trade places
Our lives are strangely our own
Mr. Ambulance Driver
Tell me
For everyone that dies
Someone new is born

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live somehow I frown

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Cause wishing I was the one that
Wasn't gonna be here anymore.

Mr. Ambulance Driver
Though I live
Somehow I found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Cause wishin I was the one that wasn't here anymore
The one that wasn't here anymore
