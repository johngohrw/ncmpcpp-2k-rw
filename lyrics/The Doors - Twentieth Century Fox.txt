Well, she's fashionably lean 
And she's fashionably late 
She'll never rank a scene 
She'll never break a date 
But she's no drag 
Just watch the way she walks 

She's a twentieth century fox 
She's a twentieth century fox 
No tears, no fears 
No ruined years, no clocks 
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah 

She's the queen of cool 
And she's the lady who waits 
Since her mind left school 
It never hesitates 
She won't waste time 
On elementary talk 

'Cause she's a twentieth century fox 
She's a twentieth century fox 
Got the world locked up 
Inside a plastic box 
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah 
Twentieth century fox, oh yeah 
Twentieth century fox 
She's a twentieth century fox
