In this day and age where changes happen twice as fast,
Sometimes I get to wonderin' if anything will last.
People changin'partners like they change their underwear,
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but darlin' I still care.

And I'm yours for life.
Come and be my lifetime.
Come and take the love I have for only one.
Yes I'm yours for life.
Come and share my lifetime
Share the world until our day is done.

From the time that I first saw your face I loved you where you stood,
In you eyes a kindliness told me you were good.
If the world could share your heart there'd never be a war,
And darling if I tried and tried I could not love you more.

And I'm yours for life.
Come and be my lifetime.
Come and take the love I have for only one.
Yes I'm yours for life.
Come and share my lifetime
Share the world until our day is done.

Sometimes I pray that you will always be the way you always are,
Are to me.
'Cause if I lost you to the winds of change then I would cease to be.

And I'm yours for life.
Come and be my lifetime.
Come and take the love I have for only one.
Yes I'm yours for life.
Come and share my lifetime
Share the world until our day is done.
