Brown Eyes and I were tired
We had walked and we had scrambled
Through the moors and through the briars
Through the endless blue meanders

In the blue August moon 
In the cool August moon

Over the nights and through the fires
We went surging down the wires
Through the towns and on the highways
Through the storms in all their thundering

In the blue August moon
In the cool August moon

Well, we rested in a desert 
Where the bones were white as teeth, sir 
And we saw St. Elmo's Fire 
Splitting ions in the ether

In the blue August moon 
In the cool August moon
