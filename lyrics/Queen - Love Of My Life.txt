Love of my life, you've hurt me,
You've broken my heart and now you leave me.
Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.

Love of my life, don't leave me,
[Album version:] You've taken my love, you now desert me,
[Live version:] You've stolen my love, you now desert me,
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.

You will remember
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side to remind you how I still love you, I still love you.

[Album version:] Back, hurry back,
[Live version:] Hurry back, hurry back,
[Album version:] Please, bring it back home to me because you don't know what it means to me.
[Live version:] Don't take it away from me, because you don't know what it means to me -

Love of my life
Love of my life...
