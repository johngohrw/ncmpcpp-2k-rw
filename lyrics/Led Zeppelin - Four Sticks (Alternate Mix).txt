Oh, Baby, it's cryin' time, Oh, Baby, I got to fly. 
Got to try to find a way, Got to try to get away, 
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, Babe. 

Oh, Baby, the river's red, Oh, Baby, in my head. 
There's a funny feelin' goin' on, I don't think I can hold out long. 

[Chorus]
And when the owls cry in the night, Oh, Baby, Baby, when the pines begin to cry, 
Baby, Baby, Baby, how do you feel? If the river runs dry, Baby, 
How do you feel? 

Craze, Baby, the rainbow's end, Baby, it's just a den 
For those who hide, Who hide their love to depths of life 
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, Babe. 

[Chorus]
