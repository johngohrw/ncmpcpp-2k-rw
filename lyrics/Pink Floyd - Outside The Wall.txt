All alone, or in twos 
The ones who really love you 
Walk up and down outside the wall 
Some hand in hand 
Some gathering together in bands 
The bleeding hearts and the artists 
Make their stand 
And when they've given you their all 
Some stagger and fall after all it's not easy 
banging your heart against some mad buggers 
Wall
