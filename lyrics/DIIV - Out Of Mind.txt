Yeah out of sight
And out of mind
But everything I should do
Just comes so easily to you

You had me first
Our shadow thirst
When roles reverse
My mind rewinds and I see you

I’m out of signs
At the end of the line
But I’ll be fine
When it’s time I’ll know what to do

The world was mine
But I’m too blind
I’ll stay behind
And choose which scrap to start anew

I’m out of sight, I’m out of mind
Out like a light, and left behind
