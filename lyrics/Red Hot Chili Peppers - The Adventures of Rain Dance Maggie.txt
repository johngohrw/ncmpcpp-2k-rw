[Verse]
Lip stick junkie
Debunked the all in one, she
Came back wearing a smile
Lookin' like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one here is on trial
It's just a turnaround
And we go, oh
And then we go oh oh oh oh

Tick tock I want to 
Rock you like the 80s
Cock blockin' isn't allowed
Tugboat Sheila 
Is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd
We better get it on the go

[Chorus]
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

[Verse]
Rain dance Maggie
Advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods
Little did I know her body 
Was warm delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit

[Chorus]
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

[Bridge]
You've got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone girl

[Chorus]
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
Our Maggie makes it in a cloud

I said hey now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud

[Outro]
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone 'bye 'bye 'bye yeah
'Bye 'bye 'bye girl

[Scat]

'Bye 'bye girl
'Bye 'bye girl
'Bye 'bye
