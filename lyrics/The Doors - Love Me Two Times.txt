Love me two times, baby 
Love me twice today 
Love me two times, girl 
I'm goin' away 
Love me two times, girl 
One for tomorrow 
One just for today 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away 

Love me one time 
I could not speak 
Love me one time 
Yeah, my knees got weak 
But love me two times, girl 
Last me all through the week 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away 

Oh, yes 

Love me one time 
I could not speak 
Love me one time, baby 
Yeah, my knees got weak 
But love me two times, girl 
Last me all through the week 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away 

Love me two times, babe 
Love me twice today 
Love me two times, babe 
'Cause I'm goin' away 
Love me two time, girl 
One for tomorrow 
One just for today 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away 
Love me two times 
I'm goin' away
