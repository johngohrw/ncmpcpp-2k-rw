You're a soft touch baby
Like a snowflake falling
My whole heart is melting.

As a warm son rises
Into joy I'm sailing
To your soft touch baby.

Eyes that shine from depths of your soul
Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves
Drawn to your side.

As a cool wind blows me
All the treetops whisper
To your soft touch baby.

As a new moon rises
Those ideas of heaven
Fall in your soft touch baby.

Eyes that shine from depths of your soul
Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves
Drawn to your side.

You're a soft touch baby
Like a snowflake falling
My whole heart is melting.

As a warm son rises
Into joy I'm sailing
To your soft touch baby.
