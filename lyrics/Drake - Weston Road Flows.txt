One of them ones
Right
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places
Lookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care and no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my Momma that I found a lady in the east
Came cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat
Now the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement
To talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
To busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
Yeah, that's right
Yeah
