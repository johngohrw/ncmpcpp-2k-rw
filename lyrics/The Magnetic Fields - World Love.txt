World LoveThe Magnetic FieldsWhen the rhythm calls the government falls, here come the copsFrom Tokyo to Soweto viva la musica popWe are black and white and we dance all night down at the hopAnd the letters were tall on the Berlin Wall viva la musica popSo if you're feeling low stuck in some bardoI, even I know the solutionLove, music, wine and revolutionLove, loveLove music, wine and revolutionThis too shall pass so raise your glass to change and chanceAnd freedom is the only law shall we dance...[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:World_Love ]
