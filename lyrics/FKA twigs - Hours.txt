I could kiss you for hours....

Who would've thought, I'd be here, in your mouth, loud and clear?

Harder... Till you fill it with me
Harder... Am I suited to fit all of your needs?
Master of all of your needs

I could kiss you for hours.... And not miss a thing, read my lips now
I could kiss you for hours.... The feeling you bring, so deep in now
I could kiss you for hours....

How would you like it if my lips touched yours, and they stayed closed, baby 'til the stars fade out?
How would you like it if I suck before I bite but it wasn't too hard so it felt alright?
How would you like it if I held you in my arms?
Round if your bed is big with supported tubes for Mmmmm Mmmm

Harder... Till you fill it with me
Harder... Am I suited to fit all of your needs?
Master of all of your needs

I could kiss you for hours.... And not miss a thing, read my lips now
I could kiss you for hours.... The feeling you bring, so deep in now
I could kiss you for hours....

Drive me heaven under the ground
The sweetest thing a girl like me has... Found

I could kiss you for hours....

Flying in a higher world of your own
I long lost boy aside a man... That's grown

I could kiss you for hours.... And not miss a thing, read my lips now
I could kiss you for hours.... The feeling you bring, so deep in now
I could kiss you for hours....
I could kiss you for hours....
I could kiss you for hours...
I could kiss you for hours..
I could kiss you for hours.
I could kiss you for hours
