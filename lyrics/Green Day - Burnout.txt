I declare I don't care no more
I'm burning up and out and growing bored
In my smoked out boring room
My hair is shagging in my eyes
Dragging my feet to hit the street tonight
To drive along these shit town lights

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead

Apathy has rained on me
Now I'm feeling like a soggy dream
So close to drowning but I don't mind
I've lived inside this mental cave
Throw my emotions in the grave
Hell, who needs them anyway

I'm not growing up
I'm just burning out
And I stepped in line
to walk amongst the dead

[Repeat many times]
