A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I dream of your first kiss
And then I feel upon my lips again

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart

That taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

Oh I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back (He'll come back) 
for the honey (For the honey) 
and you
