My best friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries,
Oh look it stopped snowing
My best friend's from Poland and, um, he has a beard.
But they caught him with his case in that public place
That is what we had feared

He severed segments secretly you like that
He always took the time to speak with me
I liked him for that.
He severed segments so secretly you like that
He always took the time, he always took the time

He severed segments so secretly you like that.
He was growing on me.
He was growing on me.
