Really hate the running really hate the game
Looking at them all I wanna be unborn again
Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin
The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in
People say that we're to blame I say
No no no it's just the game
Must we let them fool us no no no
Have we got our freedom no no no
Is it getting better no no no
Do we love each other no no no
Must we wait forever no no no

Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak
Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak
Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far
The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars
Tell them how it is and they say
No no no we know it all
The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin
It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin
They talk about creating but all they do is kill
They say we're gonna mend it but they never will
Poison in the rain but they say
No no no we ain't to blame
