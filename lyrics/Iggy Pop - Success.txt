Here comes success, here comes success
Over my hill, over my hill
Here comes success, here comes success
Here comes my car, here comes my car
Here comes my Chinese rug, here comes my Chinese rug
Here comes success, here comes success

In the last ditch, in the last ditch
I'll think of you, I'll think of you
In the last ditch, in the last ditch
I will be true, I will be true
Sweetheart I'm telling you, sweetheart I'm telling you
Here comes the zoo, here comes the zoo

Here comes success, here comes success
Oh, hooray success, hooray success
Here comes success, hooray success
Oh oh success, oh oh success
I can't help myself, I can't help myself
I just got to got to got to, I just got to got to got to...
I can't stand it, got to got to got to

Here comes my face, here comes my face
It's plain bizarre, it's plain bizarre
Here comes my face, here comes my face
Out of the crowd, out of the crowd
Sweetheart I'm telling you, sweetheart I'm telling you
Here comes the zoo, here comes the zoo

In the last ditch, in the last ditch
Here comes success, here comes success
Here comes success, here comes success
I'm gonna do the twist, I'm gonna do the twist
I'm moved, man, I'm wiggged, oh I'm moved and I'm wigged
I'm crazy, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go crazy. And if you, maybe you'd like..
Let's blast off!

Alright! Baby, let's blast off, oh, baby let's blast off
Blast off on success, blast off on success
Oh you slay me, oh you slay me, baby, ooooh, you slay me, baby
I'm gonna do the twist, I'm gonna do the twist
I'm gonna hop like a frog, I'm gonna hop like a frog
I'm gonna go out on the street and do anything I want
I'm gonna go out on the street and do anything
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
