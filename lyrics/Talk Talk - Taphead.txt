When do you know, you know, you know, you know?
Do you die in sin, born again?
With will to wind and wander
Climb through needle neck to consent

When do you know, you know, you know, you know?
Arrive at spring once again
And still to rise beyond the tide

On the mortal track
Fretful or fair
By straw, by strap
Toughening tear

Dust to dust to dust to dust consume
For what is worth
Upon me
Nascent, naissant
