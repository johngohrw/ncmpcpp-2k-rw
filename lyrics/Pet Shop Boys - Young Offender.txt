You may be broke now, and you may be bored
Call you delinquent or leave you ignored
You'll get what you want

Drive to distraction, crash on the way
Watch your reaction, wait 'til you say
You'll get what you want
It hurts if you can't

Young offender, what's your defense?
You're younger than me, obviously
Young offender, why the pretense?
You don't agree, I know, I know

I'll do what you want if you want me enough
I'll put down my book and start falling in love
Or isn't that done?

How graceful your movements, how bitter your scorn
I've been a teenager since before you were born
And I'm younger than some
I've only begun

Young offender, what's your defense?
You're younger than me, obviously

When I get in your way, or open your eyes?
Who will give whom the bigger surprise?

Is there fire in your eyes, or the glow of machines?
Watch how your fingers thumb over the keys
So sure what you do
I haven't a clue

Young offender, what's your defense?
You're younger than me, obviously
Young offender, how you resent
The lovers you need, it hurts when they bleed
Young offender, why the pretense?
You don't agree, I know, I know
