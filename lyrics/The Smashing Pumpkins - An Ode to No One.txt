I'm never coming backI'm never giving inI'll never be the shine in your spitI disconnect the actI disconnect the dotsI disconnect the me in meAnd you're mistaken, It's you that's fakingLiving and breathing and dying tooThis message is for anyoine who dares to hear a foolYou can't bring me back, you can't bring me backCause I give it all back to youThru sacred alleys, the living wrecksWreak their havoc upon this worldThe disenchanted, the romantics,The body and face and soul of you is gone down that deep black holeDestroy the mind-destroy the body-but you cannot destroy the heartAnd you, you make me so I need to disconnectAnd you make it so realI don't need your love to disconnectTo runaround kids in get-go carsWith vaseline afterbirths and neon coughsGalaxies full of nobodiesGiving us the farewell runaroundsI took a virgin mary axe to his sweet baby jane,lost my innocence to a no good girl, scratch myface with anvil hands, and coil my tongue around a bumblebee mouthAnd I give it all back to youNo way, I don't need it, I don't need your love to disconnectAnd you make it, so real, I don't need your love to disconnectNo way to disconnectAnd you make it so realI don't need your love to disconnectNo way to disconnect
