Just for today
I could try to live through this day only
Not deal with all life's problems
Just for today

If just for one night
I could feel not sad and lonely
Not be my own life's problem
Just for one night

If just (for) today
I could try to live through this day only
Not deal with all life's problems
Just for today

If just for one night
I could feel not sad and lonely
Not be my own life's problem
Just for one night

Just for today
I could try to live through this day only
Not deal with all life's problems
Just for today

Just for today
