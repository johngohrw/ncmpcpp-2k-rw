Colours, colours, colours, colours

Right there, just between the height of
My friend, something left me thinking
Stand on and focus on the fire wax
Stand back and look a little higher

So many colours fill the sky
So many good things to come
If only they'd always caught my eye
It's like an explosion

So slow, I skipped over the fall line
Lay back and imagine it's all mine
Make plans to keep them on my side
Little did I know that I'll be alright

So many colours fill the sky
So many good things to come
If only they'd always caught my eye
It's like an explosion

Stand so lost, my eyes so blind
It's just that burning change of mind
Thinking about the days gone by
Again and again

So many colours fill the sky
So many good things to come
If only they'd always caught my eye
It's like an explosion
