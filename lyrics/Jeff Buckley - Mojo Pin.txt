It's a song about a dream 

Well i'm lying in my bed 
The blanket is warm 
This body will never be safe from harm 
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal 
Touch my skin to keep me whole 

If only you'd come back to me 
If you laid at my side 
I wouldn't need no Mojo Pin to keep me satisfied 

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know 
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow 
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow 
Black beauty I love you so 

Precious, precious silver and gold and pearls in oyster's flesh 
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love 
Born again from the rhythm screaming down from heaven 
Ageless, ageless 
I'm there in your arms 

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know 
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow 
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow 
Black beauty I love you so 
So, so... 

The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more 
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more 
Well it's you I've waited my life to see 
It's you I've searched so hard for... 

Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know 
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow 
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow 
Black beauty I love you so 
So, black black black black beauty...
