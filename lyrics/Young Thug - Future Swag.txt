A solid foundation, a nation

We send them to a better place
We send them boys to meet their maker

You're kids seen me on cable, and

Hurry up where the gates at
She ain't nothin' I can't cake that
This is where the apes stay at
All you lame niggas stay back (move)
Switchin' lanes in the Maybach (skrt)

Brand new Rollie and the face black
