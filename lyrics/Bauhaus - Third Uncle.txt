There were tims 
There was pork 
There are legs 
There are skarks 
There was John 
There are cliffs 
There was mother 
There's a poker 
There was you 
Then there was you 

There are scenes 
There are blues 
There are boots 
There are shoes 
There are Turks 
There are fools 
They're in lockers 
They're in schools 
They're in you 
Then there was you 

Burn my fingers 
Burn my toes 
Burn my uncle 
Burn his books 
Burn his shoes 
Cook the leather 
Put it on me 
Does it fit me 
Or you 
It looks tight on you
