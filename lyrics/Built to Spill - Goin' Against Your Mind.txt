People think when you don't understand
What it takes to wanna be a man
I don't care much for that
I don't know why

Just a fight or just a waste of time
Hiding things that no one wants to find
I don't know much of that
I don't care why

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

When I was a kid I saw a light
Floating high above the trees one night
Thought it was an alien
Turned out to be just god

If you're not sure who not to believe
Who has better reasons to deceive?
They're really good at that
That's all they do

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind
Goin' against your mind, goin' against your mind

And we won't share
No, we won't share
And we won't share
No, we won't share
