I'm on the white cliffs of Dover
Thinking it over and over
But if I jump its all over
A cautionary tale for you
I'd like to roll in the clover
With you over and over
On the white cliffs of dover
And then I'd let you push me over

[Chorus]
AND IF THAT IS THE FACT THEN IN ACTUAL FACT IT'S NOT WHERE IT'S AT
AND IT'S OVER
AND IF THAT IS THE FACT THEN IN ACTUAL FACT IT'S NOT WHERE IT'S AT
AND IT'S OVER
YES IT IS

And now the bluebirds are over
Over the white cliffs of dover
So when you push me over
Don't bury me I'm not worth anything

[Chorus]
