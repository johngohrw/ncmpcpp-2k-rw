Caravan is lost
In the sun and the dust
No-one loves you
When you are lost
Yeah I've been a clown
Trying to pull my whole world down
I thought I was strong
But you are the one
And when it comes, you'll feel the weight of it
The weight of it
And the day and you'll get away from it,
Away from it

Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

I try to quit
But my heart won't buy it
I got family
The caravan comes back for me

And when it comes you'll feel the weight of it,
The weight of it
And the day, and you'll get away from it
Away from it

Sometimes everything is easy
Sometimes everything is easy
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la [repeat]
