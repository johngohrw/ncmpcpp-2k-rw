People worry, what are they worrying about today?
People worry, what are they worrying about today?
Seems like there's a good reason to worry, worry, worry
Seems like there's a damn good reason to worry, worry, worry
I'd sit around, I'd listen to your story if I wasn't in such a hurry, hurry, hurry

And I'm so lonely, I just don't think I can take it any more
And I'm so lonely, I just don't know what to do
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it apart

Seems like there's a good reason to be lonely, lonely, lonely
I gotta get someone or somebody or something to make me feel less lonely, lonely, lonely
I know I could do it, I know I could do it if I wasn't so lonely, lonely, lonely

Have we got an army? We'll teach you how to act like a man
Have we got an army? Man, I mean to tell you we can fight
Have we got an army? And we're gonna do it tonight
Do, do, do, do it tonight
Yeah, they're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight
Do, do, do, do it tonight...

People worry, what are they worrying about today? People worry
And you see, I've learned my lessons
And I don't even want to hear about your confessions
