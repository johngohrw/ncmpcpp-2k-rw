It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in
 
[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing
 
I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved
 
[Chorus]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing
 
I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of
 
[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing
 
[Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (amazing), yeah I'm all that (all that)
If I ain't on my grind than what you call that (what you call that)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive for victory (yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was breed to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"
 
[Outro]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing
