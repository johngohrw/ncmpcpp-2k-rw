Get down make love
Get down make love -
You take my body -

You say you're hungry
I give you meat
I suck your mind

You blow my head
Make love -
Inside your bed - everybody get down make love
Get down make love
Get down make love

Everytime I get hot
You wanna cool down
Everytime I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I get a - Get down, get down
Make love -

I can squeeze - You can shake me
I can feel - when you break me
Come on so heavy - when you take me -
You make love, you make love, you make love, you make love
You can make everybody get down make love
Get down make love

Everytime I get high
You wanna come down
Everytime I get hot
You say you wanna cool down
You say it's enough
In fact it's too much
Everytime I wanna, get down, get down get down -
Get down make love
