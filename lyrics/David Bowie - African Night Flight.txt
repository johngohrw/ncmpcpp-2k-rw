African nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman 
I went too far
Bent on a windfall 
rent a sony

Wonder 
how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well

Seemed like another day
I could fly 
into the eye of god on high

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days

Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff
skimming over Rhino

Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child 
whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine

Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

Seemed like another day
I could fly 
into the eye of god on high

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days

Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana
