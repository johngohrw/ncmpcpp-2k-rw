(Shhh! Do you wanna hear a secret? I know one)

In this place 
there's a bone in thigh 
Felt a change 
where the links bent right 
Find a name 
in the placeless age 
Girls and pain 
and your window pane 
Isolate 
from a hundred friends 
Wave them on 
as the childhood ends 
Turn it fast 
as one mild day steals 
Turn one's soul 
into 20 years 
In spirit they've vanished 
and they'll show you why 
I'll make 'em pay elder
lift my spite in time
If we were just dolphins
in the sea air fly
It's hard to just kiss our 
child games goodbye

It's hard to just kiss our 
child games goodbye.

(...You just messed the whole thing up!)
