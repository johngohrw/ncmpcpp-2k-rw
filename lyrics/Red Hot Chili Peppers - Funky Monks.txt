There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man

Confusion is my middle name
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Persuaded by one sexy dame
No I do not feel no shame

[Chorus]
You are on the road
Can I get a little lovin' from you
Can I get a little bit of that done did do
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling 4 you

Every man has certain needs
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds
To these needs I must concede
Livin' by my lowly creed

Woman please know that I'm good
Know that I did all I could
But yes it's true likelihood
Of being great is not so good

[Chorus]

There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man

Virtue slipped into my shoe
No I will not misconstrue
More rockin' more rockin' now doobley do
Dancin' down your avenue

[Chorus]
