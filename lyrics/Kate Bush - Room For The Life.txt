Hey there, you lady in tears,
Do you think that they care if they're real, woman?
They just take it as part of the deal.
Lost in your men and the games you play.
Trying to prove that you're better, woman.
But you needn't get heavy with them.
Like it or not, we were built tough,
Because we're woman.

No, we never die for long,
While we've got that little life
To live for, where it's hid inside.
No, we never die for long,
Oh! Woman, two in one,

There's room for a life in your womb, woman,
Inside of you can be two, woman,
There's room for a life in your womb, woman,
Mama woman, aha!

Night after night in the quiet house,
Plaiting her hair by the fire, woman,
With no lover to free her desire,
How long do you think she can stick it out?
How long do you think before she'll go out, woman?
Hey! Get up on your feet and go get it, now.
Like it or not, we keep bouncing back,
Because we're woman.

No, we never die for long,
While we've got that little life
To live for, where it's hid inside.
Oh! Woman, two in one,

There's room for a life in your womb, woman,
Inside of you can be two, woman,
There's room for a life in your womb, woman,
Mama woman, aha!

A-mama-woma-mama-woman-aha!
A-mama-woma-mama-woman-aha!
Oh, mama-woman, two-in-a-one, aha!
Oh, two in one, aha!
Oh, woman! Woman! Woman! Woman!
There's room for a life in your womb!
There's room for a life in your womb!
Two in one, aha!
Two in one! Two in one! Two in one!
Room for a life in your womb.
