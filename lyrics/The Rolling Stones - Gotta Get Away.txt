Baby, the truth is out so don't deny
Baby to think I believed all your lies
Darlin' I can't stand to see your face
It's the truth, you understand
I got to get away, got to get away
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away
Got to get away
Baby, I don't want to live here no more
Baby, though I tore your pictures off my walls
Darlin' this old room's falling in on me
You understand the truth now
I got to get away, got to get away
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away
Got to get away
Baby, oh, how could you take away your clothes
Baby, don't screw up this old heart of gold
Darling, this will rule my social flare
You understand me now
I got to get away, got to get away
Gotta, gotta, gotta get away
Got to get away
