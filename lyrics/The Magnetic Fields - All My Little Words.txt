All My Little WordsThe Magnetic FieldsYou are a splendid butterflyIt is your wings that make you beautifulAnd I could make you fly awayBut I could never make you stayYou said you were in love with me(You said you were in love with me)Both of us know that that's impossibleAnd I could make you rue the dayBut I could never make you stayNot for all the tea in ChinaNot if I could sing like a birdNot for all North CarolinaNot for all my little wordsNot if I could write for youThe sweetest song you ever heardIt doesn't matter what I do (it doesn't matter what I do)Not for all my little wordsNow that you've made me want to dieYou tell me that you're unboyfriendableAnd I could make you pay and pay (pay and pay and pay)But I could never make you stayNot for all the tea in ChinaNot if I could sing like a birdNot for all North CarolinaNot for all my little wordsNot if I could write for youThe sweetest song you ever heardIt doesn't matter what I do (it doesn't matter what I do)Not for all my little wordsIt doesn't matter what I'll do (it doesn't matter what I do)Not for all my little words[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:All_My_Little_Words ]
