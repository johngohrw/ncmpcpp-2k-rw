Well there's a Peter Pan moon shepherd's delight
I got to dragon at noon, yes and I won the fight
Now I want my reward in heaven tonight, just like you promised
Angel of Mercy, you'll come to no harm
Angel of Mercy, there's no need for alarm
The knight in his armor wants a night in your arms
You know he's honest

Angel of Mercy, angel delight, give me my reward in heaven tonight
And if I give up my sword, won't you give me the right
Sweet angel

Well now it's too late for talking we can talk later on
Let the saxophone play us till the chorus of dawn
And all I need is a little oblivion, you don't need protection
Well now here come the moonlight down on your bed
Angel of mercy let your heart rule your head
I don't want your money, I want you instead
Don't need rejection yeah

Angel of Mercy, angel delight, give me my reward in heaven tonight
And if I give up my sword, won't you give me the right
Angel of Mercy give me heaven tonight
Well if you cross your heart
And spit and swear upon the grave of your mother
You got to get into it, you gotta tell me that I'm more than a lover

Yeah Angel of Mercy angel delight
Give me my reward in heaven tonight
And if I give up my sword, won't you give me the right
Angel of Mercy give me heaven tonight

Yeah Angel of Mercy, angel delight
Give me my reward in heaven tonight
And if I give up my sword, won't you give me the right
Angel of Mercy give me heaven tonight

Yeah Angel of Mercy angel delight
Give me my reward in heaven tonight
And if I give up my sword, won't you give me the right
Angel of Mercy give me heaven tonight
