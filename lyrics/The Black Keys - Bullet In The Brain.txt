Bullet in the brain
I prefer them to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer them to remain the same

Looking back on where we used to be
Everything was clear, still I refuse to see
Hearts began to burst
The diamond turned to dust
And baby took the pain all out of me

Bullet in the brain
I prefer them to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer them to remain the same

I know I share the blame for what's in store
I was in the wrong but weren't you in it more?
I let you use my gifts
To back your lying lips
I'll never know just what I did it for

Bullet in the brain
I prefer them to remain the same
Bullet in the brain
I prefer them to remain the same
