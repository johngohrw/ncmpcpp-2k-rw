Bob, Bob, Bob... Bob Wood,
National programmer director of the chum group
Worked with us in producing...
Hold up, hold up, before we get started
Guess who's coming with those brothers LA, y'all
And now... Guess who's coming...
It's... Guess who's coming...
It's... Guess who's coming... DJ Shadow!
Back again, who is he?
Just your favourite DJ saviour
Using, using, using and confusing beats that ya never heard
Since 1990, put a smile on your face like ultra-bright
You're just fessing man
I don't even wanna hear about it, you're just fessing
