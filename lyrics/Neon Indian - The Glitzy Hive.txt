Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party
Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party

Little girl flipping through your phone
Where you at this time of night?

Asking for a couple dollars or more
Say your friends are waiting by

Never self-described a jealous type
Always keep the status quo

But you could be all dressed up in someone elseâ€™s love
Oh say it isn't so

Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party
Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party

Breezy shoots with quasi famous freaks
You say you're only taking five

I don't know what you see in those creeps
You know you never leave the glitzy hive

I can't argue with security
Looking for some perch to climb

But your sister told you that's no place to be
Girl, you're only wasting time, wasting time, uh

Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party
Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party

Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party
Party, she's at the monster party
Party, party

Tell me, oh won't you tell me
I've been blind this whole time
