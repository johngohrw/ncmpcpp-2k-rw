What's the matter, why don't you answer
What's the matter with me
Cause it's so hard to be
Free and easy, we'll disappear completely
Hardly as I've known it's glad

Your heart is broken, and the doors are open
As you're hoping to be
There's brighter places to see
Hands need warming, early in the morning
Hardly as I've known a surprise

No, don't warn me I know it's wrong
But I swear it won't take long
And I know, you know it makes me sigh
I do believe in love

Another season, but the same old feelings
Another reason to be
I'm tired of aching, summer's what you make it
But I'll believe what I want to believe
