And now it begins to shine
And you found the eyes to see
Each little drop at dawn of ev'ry day

Your smile, it comes back to me
And whatever you may say
Don't let it stop, never fade away

As we got to get out in this world together, oh
Doesn't really matter if we start to make some changes, oh

If that's what it takes (that's what it takes)
Then I've got to be strong (that's what it takes)
Don't want to be wrong
If that's what it takes

The closer I get (that's what it takes)
Into that open door (what it takes)
I've got to be sure
If that's what it takes

And now that it's shining through
And you can see all this world
Don't let it stop, never fade away

If we got to be in this life forever, oh-oh
Then we'd better be taking all the chances, oh oh

If that's what it takes (that's what it takes)
Then I've got to be strong (that's what it takes)
Don't want to be wrong
If that's what it takes

The closer I get (that's what it takes)
Into that open door (what it takes)
I've got to be sure
If that's what it takes

That's what it takes, that's what it takes
That's what it takes, that's what it takes
(That's) what it takes, that's what it takes
That's what it takes, (that's) what it takes
That's what it takes, oh, that's what it takes

[repeat and fade:]
Oh, that's what it takes
