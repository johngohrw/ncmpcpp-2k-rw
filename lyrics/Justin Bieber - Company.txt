Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been around no pressure, ain't that serious

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

You ain't gotta be my lover for me to call you baby
Never been around no pressure, ain't that serious no

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

Can we be, can we be, be each other's company
Be each other's company
Just be each other's company
Be each other's company

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company
