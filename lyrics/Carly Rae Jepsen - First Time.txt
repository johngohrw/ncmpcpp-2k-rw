You are the heartbreak
We'll make it feel like the first time
First time

Catching tears like raindrops here in the glass
Keep them safe in case you should ever ask
Or if you'd like, we don't need to talk about it
I don't care
I will wait right here by my windowsill
For the sun to come, if it ever will
Everyone says I can never get my fill but I don't care

We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight

Cause when my heart breaks
It always feels like the first time, first time
But if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye
Through the heartbreak
We'll make it feel like the first time, first time
And if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye

Looking back, I followed you everywhere
We were kids just playing with truth and dare
Lets be honest, no one else can take me there
B ut I don't care

We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight

Cause when my heart breaks
It always feels like the first time, first time
But if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye
Through the heartbreak
We'll make it feel like the first time, first time
And if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye

Don't you? I hope that you want to
Make it up and start it over
Don't you? I hope that you want to
Make it up and start it over
Feels like the first time

Cause when my heart breaks
It always feels like the first time, first time
But if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye (yeah, yeah)
We'll make it feel like the first time (oh-oh-oh, feels like the first time)
And if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye
