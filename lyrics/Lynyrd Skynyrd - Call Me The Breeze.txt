Call me the breeze 
I keep blowin' down the road 
Well now they call me the breeze 
I keep blowin' down the road 
I ain't got me nobody 
I don't carry me no load

Ain't no change in the weather 
Ain't no changes in me 
Well there ain't no change in the weather 
Ain't no changes in me 
And I ain't hidin' from nobody 
Nobody's hidin' from me 
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be

Well I got that green light baby 
I got to keep movin' on 
Well I got that green light baby 
I got to keep movin' on 
Well I might go out to California 
Might go down to Georgia 
I don't know

Well I dig you Georgia peaches 
Makes me feel right at home 
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches 
Makes me feel right at home 
But I don't love me no one woman 
So I can't stay in Georgia long

Well now they call me the breeze 
I keep blowin' down the road 
Well now they call me the breeze 
I keep blowin' down the road 
I ain't got me nobody 
I don't carry me no load 
Oooh Mr Breeze
