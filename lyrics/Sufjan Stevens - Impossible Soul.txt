[PART I:]

Ooh. Woman, tell me what you want
And I'll calm down without bleeding out 
With a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour
Woman, I was freaking out because I want you to know 
My beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul
Woman, too, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes
I was wigging out, too much worry, I could not get you at all
If you said what you want, you would laugh it off
But I know you won't go, not for either class
Must you write it off for the impossible soul?
And I was in a dream, I was gone away without you, but not too slow
Lest I put it off, 'fore I put it right for the impossible soul
And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all my life to you, if I could get you at all
Don't be a wreck, trying to be something that I wasn't at all
Seems I got it wrong, I was chasing after something that was gone
To the black of night, now I know it's not what I wanted at all
You said something like, "All you want is all the world for yourself"
But all I want is the perfect love, though I know it's small, I want love for us all
And all I couldn't sing, I would say it all my life to you, if I could get you at all
Oh, oh oh oh, trying to be something that I wasn't at all
Do you want to be afraid? 
Do you want to be afraid?
For life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be alone? 
Do you want to be alone?
For life is instead on righteousness led
The seat and the head, of impossible flocks for an interest in books??
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to love me more? 
Do you want to love me more?
For love is the grain
If watered and ?wind? is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame
Is it worth all the work?
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
And have you failed to feel delight? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Instead of the love, lived tired and lost, have you left it at last
Where it floundered its death with the language of ghosts?
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
Do you want to be afraid? (No, I don't want to feel pain)
For life in the cage where where courage's mate runs deep in the wake
For the scariest things are not half as enslaved
Don't be distracted, don't be distracted
Don't be distracted now

[PART II:]

Stupid man in the window 
I couldn't be addressed
All my delight, all that mattered
I couldn't be addressed
From what I liked, from what I gathered
I couldn't be addressed
Stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed
(judgement, judgement)

And don't be shy in the window
Come down and give your best
Oh, delight in the window
I couldn't be addressed
Stupid man in the window
I couldn't be addressed
From what I like, from what I gathered
I couldn't give my best

Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
(It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Now I know it wasn't safe 
It wasn't safe to breathe at all
(It wasn't safe, it wasn't safe)
Now I know it wasn't safe
It wasn't safe to speak at all

[PART III:]

(Hold on to, hold on to)
One two three four!
It's a long life
Better pinch yourself
Put your faith together
Better get it right
It's a long life
Better hit yourself
Put your face together
Better stand up straight
It's a long life 
Only one last chance
Could it get much better
Do you wanna dance
It's a long life
Better pinch yourself
Get your face together
Better stand up straight

Boy we can do much more together
Better get a life get a life get a life get a life
Boy we can do much more together
Better get a life get a life get a life get a life
Boy we can do much more together
Better get it right get it right get it right get it right
Boy we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
It's not so impossible

It's a long life
Better pinch yourself
Get your face together
Better roll along
It's a long life
Better pinch yourself
Put your face together
Better stand up straight
It's a long life
Only one last chance
Couldn't get much better
Do you wanna dance
It's a good life
Better pinch yourself
Is it possible? Is it possible?
Boy we can do much more together
Better get a life get a life get a life get a life
Boy we can do much more together
Better get a life get a life get a life get a life
Boy we can do much more together
Better get it right get it right get it right get it right
Boy we can do much more together
It's not so impossible
It's not so impossible

[more of that, plus this variation:]

In the wrong life
Everything is chance at the register
Do you wanna dance
In the right life
It's a miracle 
Possibilities. 
Do you wanna dance

[PART IV:]

I never meant to cause you pain
My burden is the weight of a feather
I never meant to lead you on
I only meant to please me, however

And then you tell me "Boy, we can do much more together."

I'm nothing but a selfish worm?
I'm nothing but a privileged puppet
And did you think I'd stay the night
And did you think I'd love you forever

And then you tell me "Boy, we can do much more together."
I gotta tell you "Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure."
I gotta tell you "Boy, we made such a mess together."
