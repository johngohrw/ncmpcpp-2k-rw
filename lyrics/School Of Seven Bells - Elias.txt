Do you remember me?
Do you remember when in the morning hours
How we would watch the stars play their song?
I would watch you pretend you were up on the screen
Singing songs and I wish then you'd always find your dreams
Someday know I didn't want to leave
No, I never let you go

Hand me yours
You are my little fire
You lifted me from the dark
When I was gonna die

Hand me yours
Nothing as changed my time
Even if you forget
You'll always be
My little fire

I know it's hard to get
I'll never understand why it turned out like this
If I should see you when
You've grown into the man I knew you'd be
And hope to see the friend who you knew then
Until then I dream of you

Hand me yours
You are my little fire
You lifted me from the dark
When I was gonna die

Hand me yours
Nothing as changed my time
Even if you forget
You'll always be
My little fire

Hand me yours
You are my little fire
You lifted me from the dark
When I was gonna die

Hand me yours
Nothing as changed my time
Even if you forget
You'll always be
My little fire
