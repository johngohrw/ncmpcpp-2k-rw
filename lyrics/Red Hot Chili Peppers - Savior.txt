Dusting off your savior
You were always my favorite
Always my man - All in a hand

To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can - Always my man

Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand - All in a hand

Just like you 'cause you made me
All that I am - All in a hand

A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and any damage done
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came

Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man - All in a hand

Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can - Always my man

I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you
Face in the sand - Safe in your hand

You were always my favorite
Always my man - All in a hand

We are the red hots and
We're loving up the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pots
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful
And different light
He's just a man and everything he does
Will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came

Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man
