A Pretty Girl Is Like...The Magnetic FieldsA pretty girl is like a minstrel showIt makes you laugh It makes you cryYou go It just isn't the same on radio It's all about the makeup and the dancing and the OhA pretty girl is like a violent crime If you do it wrong you could do time But if you do it right it is sublime I'm so in love with you, girl, It's like I'm on the moon I can't really breathe, but I feel lighter A melody is like a pretty girl Who cares if it's the dumbest in the world It's all about the way that it unfurls A pretty girl is like A pretty girl[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:A_Pretty_Girl_Is_Like... ]
