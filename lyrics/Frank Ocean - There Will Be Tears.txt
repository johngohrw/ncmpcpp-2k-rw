there will be tears
i've no doubt
there may be smiles
but a few
and when those tears
have run out
you will be numb and blue

i can't be there with you
but i can dream
i can't be there with you
but i can dream
i can't be there with you
but i can dream
i can't be there with you
but i can dream
i can't be there with you
but i can dream
i can't be there with you
but i can dream
i still dream dream dream
i still dream

my grandaddy was a player
pretty boy in a pair of gators
see i met him later on
think it was 1991
the only dad i'd ever know
but pretty soon he'd be gone too
hide my face hide my face
can't let em see me crying
cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
and they weren't crying
my friend said it wasn't so bad
you can't miss what you ain't had
well i can
i'm sad and there will be tears
i've no doubt
there may be smiles
but a few
and when those tears
have run out
you will be numb
and blue

i can't be there
that's all you had to say to me was
you couldn't be there
why couldn't you say to me
you won't be there
you could've warned me
you wouldn't be here
right here
you wouldn't be here for me
