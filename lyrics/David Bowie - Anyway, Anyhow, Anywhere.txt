[CHORUS]
I can go anyway 
(way I choose)
I can live anyhow 
(win or lose)
I can go anywhere 
(for something new)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

I can do anything 
(right or wrong)
I can talk anyhow 
(and get along)
I don't care anyway 
(I never lose)
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Nothing gets in my way
Not even locked doors
Don't follow the lines
that been laid before
I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

[CHORUS]

Anyway, anyway I choose
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself, 
Anyway, anyway I choose
