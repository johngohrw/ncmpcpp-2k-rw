Some might say that sunshine follows thunder
Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today cos they will sway over time 

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day 

Cos I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
Cos she's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend 

Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well 

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day 

Cos I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation for my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
Cos she's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently but it's all elementary my friend
