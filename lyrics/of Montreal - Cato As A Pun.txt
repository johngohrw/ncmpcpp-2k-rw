Cato, play with my head
I won't know the difference
If we're living in the novelist or statistician.

Cato, mess with my concepts, my inner vision
Like a strobing light, please confuse my every decision

I can't even pretend that you are my friend
What has happened to you and I?
And don't say that I have changed
'Cause man, of course I have

Are you far too depressed now even to answer the phone?
I guess you just want to
Shave your head, have a drink, and be left alone
Is that too much to ask?
