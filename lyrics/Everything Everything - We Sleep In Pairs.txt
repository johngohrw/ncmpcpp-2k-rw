Each night I lay beneath the Earth
I am tired of feeling powerless
With no edge and no reflected light
There is something in the way of us

Don't cry now all the wheels will turn
There'll be bluebirds over you and I
With black brains they'll come to save our lives
As our flesh becomes electrified

We sleep in pairs, just waiting

Can you take me away?
Can you stop with the lies?
Are you desperate? Yes I think I'm desperate
What's my best bet on your death bed?
Yes I'm on my last legs, and you're desperate

Blaze over me bird of paradise
Don't be fearful, don't you close your eyes
Oh sister keep the hope alive
We can run before they realize

I'm asking it to heal me

Can you take me away?
Can you stop with the lies?
Are you desperate? Yes I think I'm desperate
What's my best bet on your death bed?
Yes I'm on my last legs, and you're desperate

Can you take me away?
Can you stop with the lies?
