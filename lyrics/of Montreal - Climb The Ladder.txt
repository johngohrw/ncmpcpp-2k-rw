When I'm caught in a net and I haven't a clue
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the Ladder

When there are ghosts in my coat

and everything is askew
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder to you

All of these faces are crowding around me
with mouths open wide to devour
But they have no impact no I do not cower
knowing I'm safe in your tower

When my pencil tips broken and my brain is too
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder

When I feel like an oar in a sunken canoe
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder to you

All of these faces are crowding around me
like grey paint caked on a flower
But they have no impact no value no power
knowing I'm safe in your tower
