The way you are now
You're never gonna make the bus
Even though
Everybody's so impressed
You've got "Do androids dream of electric sheep?" under your pillow
Oh!

I saw you spit on London just like you were Peter Pan

The way you are now
You're never gonna make it in my kitchen
Last I was here I was convinced I was your favorite warrior

I've got a terrible fixation
Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy

You wanted me just for a holiday
Or was it to pad your resume?
What do you give me but unwanted breakthroughs
Strange how certain details subvert everything

They lied their way into my prism
I was molested by some hundred year old men
But all I saw was proof of God's boredom
And the dark effects of nothing natural

OMG! WTT!
Aww girl we been through hell about it!
Then I see our friends and...
Everybody's so excited!
I'm standing over you eating juicy fruits till it gets in your eye!

I've got a terrible fixation
Can't get it off my mind
Don't really want to know it better
Want to keep it in the realm of fantasy
