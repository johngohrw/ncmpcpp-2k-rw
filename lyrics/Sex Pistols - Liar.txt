Lie lie lie lie liar you lie lie lie lie
Tell me why tell me why
Why d'you have to lie
Should've realised that you
Should've told the truth
Should've realised
You know what I'll do

You're in suspension
You're a liar

Now I wanna know 
Now I wanna know 
Why you never look me in the face
Broke a confidence just to please your ego 
Should've realised
You know what I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar

I know where you go everybody you know
I know everything that you do or say
So when you tell lies I'll always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool and I know all
'Cos I know what I know

You're in suspension 
You're a liar
You're a liar 
You're a liar
Lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie

Lie lie lie lie liar you lie lie lie lie
I think you're funny, you're funny ha ha
I don't need it don't need your blah blah
Should've realised I know what you are
You're in suspension 
You're in suspension
You're in suspension 
You're a liar
You're a liar 
You're a liar
Lie lie
