Mister Banker 
Mister please, how much does money mean 
Won't you reconsider mister 
Won't you do this thing for me 
Ain't got no house 
Ain't got no car 
All I got, Lord, is my guitar 
But you can have that mister banker 
Won't you bury my papa for me 
Oh mister banker please 
Listen to how that sound 

I would not be here on my knees 
But hey mister banker 
It means so much to me 
Oh won't you reconsider mister 
Won't you do this thing for me 

I told you mister 
I ain't got no house 
Ain't got no car 
I got me a 1950 Les Paul guitar 
Won't you take it mister banker 
Won't you bury my papa for me 
Oh mister banker please
