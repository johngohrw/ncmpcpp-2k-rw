Oooh Doggies!
We wanna play in the sunshine
We wanna be free
Without the help of a Margarita or Exstacy
We wanna kick like we used 2
Sign up on the dotted line
We gonna dance every dance
Like it's gonna be the last time

We got 2 play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up 2 10
I want 2 meet U (meet U), kiss U (kiss U),
love U (love U), and miss U (miss U)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

Play in the sunshine

We gonna love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're gonna rock him
We're gonna roll him
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)

Aah, pop goes the music
When the big white rabbit begin 2 talk
And the color green will make your best friends leave ya
It will make them do the walk
But that's cool
Cuz one day, everyday will be a yellow day
and let's play

We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

play, play, play, play, play, play, play
We gonna play in the sunshine
We're gonna get over
I'm feelin' kind of lucky 2 night
I'm gonna find my 4-leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun

(play), (play),
(play) no, (play) no, (play) no
(come on, play) no!, (play) no!, (playplayplay) Yes!

Drummer, do your thang
Drummer, drummer, do your thang
Drummer, drummer, drummer
can I get some of that?

Let's get out of here (yeah)
(lalalalalalala play, laugh in the sunshine)
we're not afraid 2 (play, laugh in the sunshine)
we are going 2
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
