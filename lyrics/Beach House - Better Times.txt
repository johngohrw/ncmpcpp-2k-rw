I want you to know the truth
'cause I've been around before
Though I was looking anymore

Been a fool for weeks
'cause my heart stands for nothing and your soul's too weak
Got a will that's been around for days
Goes far if you want it
It needs to behave

But then you, you come around
Big mistake

I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know better times

Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire before you turn into a liar?

I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore
But then we, we come and go, go up in smoke

I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know better times
