Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before

[Hook: Swae Lee] 
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 1: Swae Lee] 
Chopped and screwed up,
I'm a pot head, true enough, yup
At your ex crib, and ya boo'd up
Take it slow baby, we ain't in no rush
Henessy or Don Q, that's a very hard choice
for the diamonds on my pinky need a gang of cool points
In the drop head make em drop dare ya
You ain't scared, you ain't scared, you ain't scared, yuh
Believe me, I'm hot shit
You see me in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' round blunts like a hot potato
And you dancin' on the table gushin' like volcano

[Hook: Swae Lee] 
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy] 
You got girls in here, Im recruitin
And they fine, hop the line
I been sippin' on Patron and wine
I'm just tryna have a good fuckin' time, hey
I was chillin' with the open container, container
Grabbed her arm, told her not to be a stranger
I been blowin' on the dank with my niggas
I been lookin' for the girls who willin'
Baby girl, if you fuckin' with me then we getting bags, big bags
If you smokin' with me, then we on dabs, good dabs
I don't fuck with local hoes, I told you that
How you movin', you deserve a couple racks

Shit aye aye aye you better get your girls off me man
I thought she just wanted a picture
Don’t treat me like no lil nigga now
Sremmlife!!!

[Hook: Swae Lee] 
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Hunnids on your face, baby girl, come and do that little thing that you was doin'
Hey, they was in this mother fucker trippin', what the hell they think we was doin'
It seem like we fuckin' in this club, baby girl, what they think that we doin'
You getting on my nerves with them questions,
Girl you know I'm tryna start a little movement

I Ain't got no business fuckin' with you,
Out the blue, you actin' brand new
Washington’s mean nothing to you,
Same way with us

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
