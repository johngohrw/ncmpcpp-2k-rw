Aaah
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I’m gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a beanbag
Turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

You’re the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
Be your Minpin
And borrower of handsome trivia

Hey!

Ooh, devour me
Aaah
Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing
Hey!

Do, do do do, do do do do
Do do do, do do do, do do do do, do do
Do, do do do, do do, do do, do do
Do do do, do do

All hand claps
You will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I want to be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes, I’m gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw-dusted patios
I’m gonna kiss you like the sun browns you

Hey!

Oh oh oh oh oh devour me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh devour me
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh)
If you really think that you can stomach me

Hey hey!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
Freckle
