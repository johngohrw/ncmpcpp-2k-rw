Now look what you've done
Now look what you've done
Look what you've done baby
Now look what you've done
You left me here
The lonely one
And all I can say
Is look what you've done
A broken heart
A worried mind
Because of you baby
Dying all the time
I once had a dream
But now I've none
Your taking your love
And see what it done
I saw you last night
Out moving round
With your new turf
You paint the town
That is OK
You're having your fun
Because some day
They call you done
And now your bird cries
The shadow falls
Gloomy memories
And I recall
Your love is my life
As warm as the sun
But now it is gone
And see what it done
