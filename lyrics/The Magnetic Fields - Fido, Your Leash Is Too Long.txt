Fido, Your Leash Is Too LongThe Magnetic FieldsFido, your leash is too longYou go where you don't belongYou've been digging in the rubbleGettin' bitches in troubleFido, your leash is too longFido, your leash is too longI don't know where I went wrongYou scare me out of my wits When you do that Shih TzuFido, your leash is too longFido, you've gone far enoughI must have all of your loveYou just run out of luckI don't care what you foxhoundsDo, but your leash is too long[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Fido%2C_Your_Leash_Is_Too_Long ]
