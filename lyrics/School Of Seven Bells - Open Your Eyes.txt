Open your eyes now
All alone
Open your eyes now
Breathing

I know that you were strong but life is moving on so
Get it together cause now anger is your pleasure and
That pleasure is a tether that fits you for too long
Now you're thinking that you're better
Cause you think it made you strong but

What you don't get is the color of regret
Is the thing that made you sweat
When you tried to paint a picture of life
Then the future when the present's still wet
With the tears that you wiped long ago, feeling the fire still
Keeping your head turned around in the past
Float in the present with the role that you cast for her
As the villain and you, who came in last
It's time to wake up

Open your eyes love
Cause you've been sleeping
It's getting hard to bear
Watching you all alone
I know your heart is broken
And you've been weeping
But I've been waiting here
Patiently for too long

I know that she was wrong when life is moving on and
The anger that you feel keeps you feeling justified but
Turning a blind eye to the one who you survived with and
Kept you sane through the heartache and the pain

What you don't get is the color of regret
Is the thing that made you sweat
When you tried to paint a picture of life
Then the future when the present's still wet
With the tears that you wiped long ago, feeling the fire still
Keeping your head turned around in the past
Float in the present with the role that you cast for her
As the villain and you, who came in last
It's time to wake up

Open your eyes love
Cause you've been sleeping
It's getting hard to bear
Watching you all alone
I know your heart is broken
And you've been weeping
But I've been waiting here
Patiently for too long

You are the pain, love
You are my sorrow
Can't you see we're the same?
You got me crying and
Now my heart is breaking
Cause I've been weeping
And I've been waiting here
Silently for too long

You come close when you're in pain
Do you feel better, babe?
Then you go cause you're afraid
You'll fall in love again
You'll fall in love again
You'll fall in love again

Open your eyes, love, you've got me crying
Open your eyes, love, you've got me crying
Open your eyes, love, you've got me crying
Open your eyes, love, you've got me crying

Open your eyes, love, you've got me crying
Cause I've been sitting here patiently for too long
