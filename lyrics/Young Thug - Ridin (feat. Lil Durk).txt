Spent my last 50 bands on a watch
Nigga playing I’ma laugh on the spot
Ho I can make you look like an amateur tonight
I can fuck a bitch on a bus like she Rosa Parks
Nigga’s diamonds soaking wet, yours dark
Keep me out it baby, that between y'all
Fuck her bad like I’m tryna catch a charge
Fuck her fast like I’m tryna catch a charge
Yeah, play with me in broad nigga, I’ma shoot a motherfucker, yeah y'all

Yeah, I’ma fuck your bitch while you all gone
Yeah you all gone, but the dog home
And the panties that your daughter don’t have on
She gon’ get what she wants, temper tantrum
Every freezin' diamond she got ain’t no silicone
I’m a gangster, I was hanging at a killer’s home
And my girl kinda crazy so tell me

Pussy, I ain’t even know that you rap
Shooters gon’ pull up in that whack shit, yeah
Drive by and start an exit, yeah
Dump the whole clip in my ex-bitch, yeah
Eat the pussy, dip on some fast shit, yeah
Put a case on that pussy ‘cause I’ma smash it
If I eat it she gotta be a Kardashian
Police pulling us over, she gon’ stash it
And I know she ain’t gon’ say shit
Any rapper in the city I don’t play with
Any time I pull up in broad day shit
Call my shooters from the go and they gon’ spray shit
Now she want to fuck me now, I got a waitlist
Told the judge suck my dick, fuck probation
And I got to get this money on vacation
Verified in the streets, fuck a placement
Put this 40 in his face, rearrange shit
