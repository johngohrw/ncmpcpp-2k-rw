Let the penny, let the penny, let the penny drop
Does she love you? Does she love you? Does she love you not?
You're in trouble if you think you're gonna need your brain, your brain

I don't need any more of this (I don't need any more of this)
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You look so tired and I know you're feeling hella bereft
The reason she left and (oh)
It's your birthday, it's your death day
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Oh Anna I've done, oh Matthew I've done
The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst
A good thing (don't you think about it, don't you make it real)
A bad thing (maybe it's a feeling I don't wanna feel)

Love, love is all you need to know
Love, love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't

I don't need any more of this (I don't need any more of this)
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You look so tired and I know you're feeling hella bereft
The reason she left and (oh)
It's your birthday, it's your death day
It's a war, it's a war, it's a war, it's a war
Oh Anna I've done, oh Matthew I've done
The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst
A good thing (don't you think about it, don't you make it real)
A bad thing (maybe it's a feeling I don't wanna feel)

Love, love is all you need to know
Love, love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't

Shake the money, shake the money, shake the money tree
Leave the city, leave the city, leave the city be
So terrified of anything that makes you whole, you whole
Make your living selling promises that you forget
Put your head between the horror and a parapet
Your body's gonna levitate above the wall, the wall

Love, love is all you need to know
Love, love is all you need to know
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
Are you trying to be clever? Cause you're better when you don't
