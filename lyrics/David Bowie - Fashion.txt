There's a brand new dance
but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes 
do again and again
It's big and it's bland 
full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

[CHORUS]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad 
and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk,
but it's not very clear
That people from good homes 
are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless 
and I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing 
on the whole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

[CHORUS]

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
La-la la la la la la-la
