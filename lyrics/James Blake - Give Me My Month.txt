Give me my month as a lucky one 
Let me see where she is going 
Oh let me see where she has gone 
Let me see where she has gone 

Help me back south with my changing love 
Ever told her where the fear comes from 
I never told her where the fear comes from 
I never told her where the fear comes from 

Halfway through the night she won't have come 
Or seen where I have been in the time 
We were undone 
In the time we were undone 
In the time we were undone
