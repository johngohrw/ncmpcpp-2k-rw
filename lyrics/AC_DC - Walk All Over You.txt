Outta my way I'm a running high
Take a chance with me and ya give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world I know
Cause I ain't lookin' for an overflow
Baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off your high heels and let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there
I'm wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) baby
I'm wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
I'm glad you got to see it all
We're rising falling like at sea
Your lookin' so good under me
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) to you
I'm gonna walk all over
You

Moanin' groanin' stereo
Said gimme the stage I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be the night
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over
You

I'm gonna walk all over you
