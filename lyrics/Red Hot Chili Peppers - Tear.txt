This is my time
This is my tear
I can see clearly now
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time
This is my tear

Comin' on strong
Baudelaire
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime

All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know

Devil may cry devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time

California skies
Got room to spare
This is my time

All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know

Take it outside
Take it out there
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time

All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
