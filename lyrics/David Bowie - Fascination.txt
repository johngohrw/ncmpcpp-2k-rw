Got to use her
Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to 
use her
Every time I think of what she pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya

[CHORUS]
(Fascination) fascination
(sho 'nuff) fascination
(takes a part of me) takes 
a part of me
(Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat
(live in a fever) live in a fever?
(raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(oh, yeah) oh yeah
(takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(every time, ooh)
Fascination comes around

(Ooh-oo-ooh)
(Fascination) Your soul is calling

Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick

[CHORUS (twice)]
