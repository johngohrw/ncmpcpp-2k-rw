Crossed the path, then I followed your face
It was hard to believe, it was hard to trace
I saw you today, seems like I see your everyday
But there's something I figured out 'bout you...

You're so ugly -- I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly -- don't make a mistake
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

You're so ugly -- all the time
You're so ugly -- you ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

When you smile or a frown, I'm so tired of you being around
Engaged in some sexual acts, well, I'm just gonna have to tell you all the facts
What could that be about, well, here's a clue...

You're so ugly -- I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly -- don't make a mistake
'Cause you ugly -- I'm tellin' you that
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

You're so ugly -- all the time
You're so ugly -- you ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

You're so ugly -- a-la, la, la, la...
You're so ugly...
