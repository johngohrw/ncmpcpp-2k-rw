Gimme 4
Cause its all right
Yea we're gonna go swimming tonight
Pavement shores
Gutter low tide
Couldn't be a red cloud in sight

And the streets in knots
Red lights like blood clots
Red eyes like gunshots
We're the pontoon goons
Every song is a favorite tune

Cause we all know how to do the side walk
Yeah we all learned how to do the side walk
And its gonna be alright
Cause we seen it all before, well alright

Street level line of sight
Just trying to survive the night
Street level line of sight
With a head full of pesticide
Just trying to survive the night

I let her take the wheel till my mind anneals
She's so giving in times like this, you know
She says, if you get lost in the rhythm of it
You just follow the kick

Till I see the sunrise
Till my eyelids capsize
Shake those busy bodies if you got em'
Watch em' from my purple bottle glass bottom

Cause we all know how to do the side walk
Yeah we all learned how to do the side walk
And its gonna be alright
Cause we seen it all before, well alright

Street level line of sight
Just trying to survive the night
Street level line of sight
With a head full of pesticide
Just trying to survive the night
