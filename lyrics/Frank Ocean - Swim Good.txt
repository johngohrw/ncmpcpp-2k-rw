that's a pretty big trunk
on my Lincoln town car ain't it
big enough to take these broken hearts
and put em in it..
now I'm driving round
on the boulevard trunk bleeding
and every time the cops pull me over
they don't ever see them
they never see them

and I've got this black suit on
roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
5 more miles till the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
imma try to swim from something
bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good
and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good
and swim good
good

got some pretty good beats
on this 808 CD, yeah
memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
i would've put tints on my windows
but what's the difference?
if i feel like a ghost no Swayze
ever since i lost my baby
I've had this black suit on
roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
one more mile till the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
imma try to swim from something
bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good
and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good
and swim good
good

I'm going off
don't try stopping me
I'm going off
don't try saving me
no flares
no vest
no fear
waves are washing me out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
imma try to swim from something
bigger than me
kick off my shoes
and swim good
and swim good
take off this suit
and swim good
and swim good
good
