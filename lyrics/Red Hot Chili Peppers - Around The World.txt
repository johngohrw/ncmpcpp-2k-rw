All around the world
We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime

Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls
From California

Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good god girl
I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby
'Cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world
Back from Bombay

Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me

I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the Swiss mountains

Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
'Cause we're rockin' Ohio

Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful

I know I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang.
I know I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, deng, deng, dong, dong, ding, dang.

Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you

You say hello then I say I do
