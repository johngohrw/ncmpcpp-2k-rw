Late night in lake park
I wait for you to see me
My eyes open, standing watch for hours
Wearing your favorite thing

I awoke, pleasing you so slowly
I'm giving you time
And the soft light on your made brow
I'm asking you to show me how

How
Show me now
Show me your second face
Show me
How you make your second face

Fingers situate themselves in dark
Moving the way that is so easy
And in summer bright
Your shout on the surface, warm

I throw a box-full of oranges syrup
Seeping out, searching for a season smell
I run from you then walk back to
You, who I don't know
I'm sniffling for a light

Show me now
Show me your second face
Show me
How you make your second face

What did I do to make you feel so bad?
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?

What did I do to make you feel so bad?
Feel so bad
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?
Feel so bad baby
(Feel so bad)
