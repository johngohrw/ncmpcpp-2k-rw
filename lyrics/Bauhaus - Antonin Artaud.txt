The young man held a gun to the head of God 
Stick this holy cow 
Put the audience in action 
Let the slaughtered take a bow 
The old man's words, white hot knives 
Slicing through warm butter 
The butter is the heart
The rancid peeling soul 

Scratch pictures on asylum walls 
Broken nails and matchsticks 
hypodermic hypodermic hypodermic 
RED FIX 

One man's poison another man's meat 
One man's agony another man's treat 
Artaud lived with his neck paced firmly in the noose 
Eyes black with pain, 
Limbs in cramps contorted 
The theatre and its double 
The void and the aborted 

THOSE INDIANS WANK ON HIS BONES [repeat]
