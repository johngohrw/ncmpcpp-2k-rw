Our stepmom, we did everything to hate her 
She took us down to the edge of Decatur 
We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her 
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator 

Sangamon River, it overflowed 
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator 
Civil War skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator 

The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train
Stephen A. Douglas was a great debater
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator 

Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill, and I know how bad it feels
Stay awake and watch for the data
No small caterpillar, go congratulate her

Denominator, go Decatur, go Decatur
It's the great I am 
Abominate her, go Decatur, why did we hate her? 
It's the great I am 
Denominator, go Decatur, anticipate her 
It's the great I am 
Appreciate her, appreciate her
Stand up and thank her

Stand up and thank her
It's the great I am
Stand up and thank her
It's the great I am
Stand up and thank her
It's the great I am
Stand up and thank her
