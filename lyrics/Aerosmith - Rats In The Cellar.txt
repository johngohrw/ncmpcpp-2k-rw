Goin' under, rats in the cellar 
Goin' under, skin's turnin' yellow 
Nose is runny, losin' my connection 
Losin' money, getting no affection 

New York City blues 
East side, West side blues 
Throw me in the slam 
Catch me if you can 
Believe 
That you're wearing 
Tearing me apart 

Safe complaining, 'cause everything's rotten 
Go insanin', and ain't a thing forgotten 
Feelin' cozy, Rats In The Cellar 
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow 
Loose and soggy, lookin' rather lazy 
See my body, pushin up the daisies 

New York City's dues 
East side, west side news 
Throw me in the slam 
Catch me if you can 
Believe 
That you're wearing 
Tearing me apart

New York City blues
East side, west side blues
Throw me in the slam
A catch me if you can
Believe
That you're wearing
Tearing me apart
