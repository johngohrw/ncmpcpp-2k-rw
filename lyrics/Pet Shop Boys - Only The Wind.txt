It's only the wind blowing litter all around
Just a little wind and the trees are falling down
There's nobody crying, that was yesterday
Inside we're all smiling, everything's okay

It's only the wind blowing cans along the street
Someone's dustbin lid playing havoc with the peace
There's nobody hiding behind a locked door
And no one's been lying, 'cause we don't lie any more

It's only the wind, how it takes you by surprise
Suddenly begins, then before you know it dies
My hands are not shaking, I don't touch a drop
You must be mistaken, I know when to stop

When life is calmer, I have no doubt
No angry drama, a storm blows itself out

It's only the wind, they say it's getting worse
The trouble that it brings haunts us like a curse
My nerves are all jangled, but I'm pulling through
I hope I can handle what I have to do

When life is calmer, I have no doubt
No angry drama, a storm blows itself out
A storm blows itself out...

I'm sorry
