All the stars may shine bright
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
Ohh how I feel so good
That I can hardly wait

To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me

All mine.......
You have to be

From that cloud, number nine
Danger starts the sharp incline
And such sad regrets
Ohh as those starry skies
As they swiftly fall

Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me

All mine....
You have to be

Don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day I die
Until the day I die

All mine.......
You have to be
