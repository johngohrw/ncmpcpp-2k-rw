Watchin' you move across the floor
You're fire up my mind can't take it no more
You're a fancy dancer
Makin' me blind so I can't see
You're a fancy dancer
And you ain't no good for me
You know you're comin' on strong
You're my favorite misery

You captured my soul - imprisoned my heart
You know you control whatever you start 
You're fancy dancer
And it ain't too hard to see
You're fancy dancer
And you'll make a fool of me 
I know it won't be for long
Until you dance a new song
But just for tonight won't you dance your dance for me

I'm not the first and I won't be the last
Don't want your future - just make the night last
C'mon fancy dancer
Make me blind so I can't see
You're a fancy dancer
And you ain't no good for me
Yeh, we both knew from the start
You'd try do dance with my heart
But just for tonight won't you dance your dance for me
