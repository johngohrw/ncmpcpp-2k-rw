One shot all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed

'Til death do us part
Break my heart so I can start

Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this

[Chorus:]
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time
It's right on time it's right on time it's right on
time it's right on time
Lookin' fine you're lookin' fine get on 1999
It's right on time

Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars

Holy cow bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now

Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate
Chorus

Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain

Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for the show

All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turning up in solid stated

Oh Lord
