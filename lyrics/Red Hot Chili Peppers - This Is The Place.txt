This is the place
Where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast
But everything gets slow

Can I get some Vaseline
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that
Which seems to be
The making of a dream

I don’t want to do it
Like my Daddy did
I don’t want to give it
To my baby’s kid

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

This is the place
Where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you
What they need

Can I isolate your gene
Can I kiss your dopamine
In a way I wonder
If she’s living in a magazine

I don’t want to say it
If it isn’t so
I don’t want to weigh it
But I’ve got to know

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

I saw you out there yesterday
What did you want to say
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you want to say
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray

Can I smell your gasoline
Can I pet your wolverine
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean

I don’t want to take it up
With Little Joe
I don’t want to fake it
So I’ve got to go

This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you

I’m a misfit
I’m born with all of it
The fucking ultimate
Of love inside the atom split

I’m in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another poppin’ Jay
Who thinks he’s got
Something to say
