Save your fragile mama's heart,
And though she will come for you,
But I wander
 
And I wonder,
Just how far will you need to be,
For shaking talk so easily,
For hours on end I wander,
Still I don't even...know her
 
Feel just like I need to be,
Back where I was,
Before I couldn't do that,
And I wander
 
And I wonder,
Just how far will you need to be,
For shaking talk so easily,
For hours on end I wander,
Still I don't even know
 
How it keep a lid on me,
How it keep a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me
 
And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be,
For shaking tough so easily,
For hours on end I wander
 
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me (and I wonder),
How it keeps a lid on me (just how far will you need to be),
How it keeps a lid on me (for shaking tough so easily),
How it keeps a lid on me (for hours on end I wonder),
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me,
How it keeps a lid on me
