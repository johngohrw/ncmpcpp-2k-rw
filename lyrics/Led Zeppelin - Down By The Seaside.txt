Down by the seaside. See the boats go sailin' 
Can the people hear, What the little fish are sayin' 

Oh, oh, the people turned away. Oh, the people turned away 

Down in the city streets, see all the folk go racin', racin' 
No time left, to pass the time of day 

The people turned away. The people turned away 
So far away, so far away 

See how they run, see how they run, see how they run, see how they run. 

Do you still do the twist 
Do you find you remember things that well 
I wanna tell you... Some go twistin' every day 
though sometimes it's awful hard to tell 

Out in the country, hear the people singin' 
Singin' 'bout their progress, knowin' where they're goin' 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, the people turned away 
Yes, the people turned away 

Sing loud for the sunshine, pray hard for the rain 
And show your love for Lady Nature. And she will come back again 
The people turned away 
The people turned away
