Why
This uncertainty?
It's not clear to me
Would you rather be independent?
Have I lost your love?
Have you had enough?
Do you feel too much resentment?
How can I make you see
When you disagree
That you just can't leave?

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

I
Won't stand in your way
I can make you stay
Though, of course, I feel rejected
You're a part of me
You're the family
I can't bear to leave

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

Feel
Free
To leave
If you think you're trapped, but
Please
Believe
I'll always want you back

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me

One in a million men
Could change the way you feel
One in a million men
Baby it's up to me
