All voices move out from the order that we left them.
Turn up and turn around - hear them call your name.
If you call out, I will follow you.

Meeting at the bus-stop, the early morning look-out crowd.
Dizzy from the tire view - hear them call your name.
"Then the others follow; one, two: one, two; one two ...
Birds are singing up and down, and all around us"

If you call out, I will follow you.
