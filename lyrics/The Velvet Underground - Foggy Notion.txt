She's over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder harder harder
Till they thought she might die

Well I got a foggy notion, do it again
Over by the corner, do it again
I got my calamine lotion baby, do it again
I got a foggy notion, do it again

She made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a bundle a beautiful batch
Don't you know something, she sent 'em right back
