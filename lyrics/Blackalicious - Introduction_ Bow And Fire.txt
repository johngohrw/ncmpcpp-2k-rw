Ladies and gents, soul music lovers everywhere
All around the universe
You know as well as I do that things are changing
Changing, changing
The day will come, warning, warning

I got my arrow, I got my bow
I got my fire and I'm walking through the darkness
Slowly on a tight-rope wire
Got my arrow

The forces trying, trying, tired
Then the wind is blowing harder
But my power comes from higher sources
Arrow

I got my bow, I got my fire
And I'm walking through the darkness
Slowly on a tight-rope wire
Got my

Arrow
