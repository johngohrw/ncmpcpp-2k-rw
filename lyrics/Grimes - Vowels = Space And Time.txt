Speak it all the time, speak it all the time
And I'll never tell you what is mine
I don't know what it means, but I see it, it's fine
It's hardly any other it can borrow inside
Think it all the time think it all the time
And I know that I tell you but boy its mine
I don't know what it is and that it is fine
It's hardly any other it can borrow inside

Oooh

Being myself makes me feel like I can't touch the ground
Here on the earth makes me feel like I can't get the sound
Being myself makes me feel like I know who you are
Cause boy you can be what the words who you are what you are

Ah uh ah uh
I don't want to let you go
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Ohhh, boy you need to know
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Oh, You could be a better friend
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Cause I could be a better man

Sometimes you know that I wonder why (up and down up and down)
I don't wanna dream but boy I'm lying upside down

Being myself makes me feel like I don't know the trees
Cause boy you can be what you, what you want to be
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Ohh, I don't want to let you go
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Ohh, you're tying me low
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Ohh, You could be a better friend
(ah uh ah uh ah uh)
Ohh and I could be a better man
