How will I ever know you enough to love you
if you're hiding who you are?
Don't ask me to explain.
Who are you hiding you from,
across the table with a penny in each eye?
Don't ask me to explain.

I'd like to marry all of my close friends,
And live in a big house together by an angry sea.
Am I the devil's marbles don't move on without me
Who will be watching my body when I sleep?
Who will I believe in?

How am I supposed to let it show when I don't even know?
Don't ask me to explain.

Besides, I don't want to be the one whose coming out first,
I'd really like to but I'm just too shy.
Don't ask me to explain.

I'd want to marry all of my close friends,
And live in a big house together by an angry sea.
Am I the devil's marbles don't move on without me
Who will be watching my body when I sleep?
Who will I believe in?

It's so easy to lie to myself
and pretend that I could love you but I can't
