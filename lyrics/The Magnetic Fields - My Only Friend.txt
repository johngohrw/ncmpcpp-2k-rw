My Only FriendThe Magnetic FieldsBillie you're a miracle and God knows I need oneSing me something terrible that even dawn may comeYou and me, we don't believe in happy endingsHey, Lady Day, can you save my life this time?Can you cry so beautifully you make my troubles rhyme?Hey, Lady Day, can you save my life again?My only love has gone awayWill you be my only friend?Billie you're a genius enough to be a foolA fool to gamble everything and never know the rulesSome of us can only live in songs of love and troubleSome of us can only live in bubblesHey, Lady Day, can you save my life again?My only love has gone awayWill you be my only friend?[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:My_Only_Friend ]
