You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me, oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you

But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you
