The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes
at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie 
the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song 
when the heroine dies

Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green
