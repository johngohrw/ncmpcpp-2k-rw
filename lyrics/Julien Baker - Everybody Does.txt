Let me pick through the empty dirt
And the rotten wood and the shoddy work
Cause I'm interested, and our carpenter is so elegant at placing splinters
Right beneath my nails, where I cannot dig them out
But the same briars from your ribs are the tinder in my father's house

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know myself better than anybody else
And you're gonna run
You're gonna run when you find out who I am
I know I'm a pile of filthy wreckage you will wish you'd never touched
But you're gonna run when you find out who I am
Yeah, you're gonna run

You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
