Drag him out your window
Dragging out your dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps

The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face

Take it to the taxman
Let me back let me back

In a tight little world and why are you on the list?

Investments and dealers investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses

I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
But I'll never see them again
If I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna'
