Up from solid ground, wade in dirt and sun.
I go outside.
We plan a purposefully play.
We go outside.

Bird-full and summe gone,
step to one side.
Telepathic creature love,
fall out one side.

Figure two feet tall,
in the morning time you'll follow.
If you can remember feet,
if I can keep track of paws.
