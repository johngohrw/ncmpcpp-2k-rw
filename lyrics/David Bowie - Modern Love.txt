I know when to go out 
And when to stay in 
Get things done [spoken]

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern Love walks beside me
Modern Love walks on by
Modern Love gets me to the Church on Time
Church on Time terrifies me 
Church on Time makes me party
Church on Time puts my trust in God and Man 
God and Man no confessions
God and Man no religion
God and Man don't believe
in Modern Love
