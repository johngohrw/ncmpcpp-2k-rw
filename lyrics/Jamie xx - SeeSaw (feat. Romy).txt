[Intro: Romy Madley Croft]
With you [x10]

Like a seesaw
Up and down

On a seesaw
Up and down
Up and down with you

A seesaw
Up and down

On a seesaw
Up and down
Up and down with you

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I see pictures in my mind
(With you)
I see fingers up your spine
(With you)
I saw my heart break in two
(With you)
I saw her again
With you

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft]
A seesaw
Up and down
On a seesaw
Up and down
Up and down with you

With you [x12]

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
I can see it your eyes
(With you)
I see through your thin despise
(With you)
She was always my best friend
(With you)

I saw you with her again
I see pictures in my mind
I see fingers up my spine
I saw my heart break in two
I saw her again with you
With you [x4]

[Outro:]
Just stuff
The world just
I just
