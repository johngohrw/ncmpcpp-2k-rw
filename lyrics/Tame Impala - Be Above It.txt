Gotta be above it...

And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can’t let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd

And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I know that I gotta be above it now

And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down

This time I’m just gonna take or I’m never gonna shake it, 
I’ll just close my eyes and make so that all these little things don’t affect me now

I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down

This time I’m just gonna take or I’m never gonna shake it, 
I’ll just close my eyes and make so that all these little things don’t affect me now

Gotta be above it...
