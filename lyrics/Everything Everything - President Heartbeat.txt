(President Heartbeat)

Were you born in a cave now?
Do you live in a cage now?
If you burst into flame now
Will they call you a human being?

And your spine is a glass spire
And your flesh is the concrete
And your blood is the sewer
And your scream is the city wall

Well I wanna be different
But it never gets different
And you promised me Heaven
And you said it would happen soon

Can you [?] inside me?
Can you radicalise me?
Can you take me to violence?
Can you take away everything?

(President Heartbeat)
Turn me into somebody new
(President Heartbeat)
Turn me into somebody new
Thanks a million
Yeah thanks for nothing at all
Thanks a million
Yeah thanks for nothing at all
[x2]

Do you live in the new world
On the grave of the old world?
With a coffin of sunlight
That you carry upon your back

You'd have battered your ankle
And they're crushing your eyeball
And they're [?] cycle
And the way you don't even feel

Well I think about living
And I think about burning
And I think about dying
And I think about all this fear

And I wanna be useful
And I wanna be hopeful
What's the matter with hopeful?
I just wanna get out of here

(President Heartbeat)
Turn me into somebody new
(President Heartbeat)
Turn me into somebody new
Thanks a million
Yeah thanks for nothing at all
Thanks a million
Yeah thanks for nothing at all
[x2]

(President Heartbeat)
Turn me into somebody new
(President Heartbeat)
Turn me into somebody new
Thanks a million
Yeah thanks for nothing at all
Thanks a million
Yeah thanks for nothing at all

(President Heartbeat)
Eee...
(President Heartbeat)
Aah...
(President Heartbeat)
Ohh...
(President Heartbeat)
You must've known this was coming
