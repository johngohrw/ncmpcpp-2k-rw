(Where you from man?)
What is going on in Compton, I don't understand it?
Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre

[Dr. Dre:]
I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost (the utmost)
All you niggas the utmost (the utmost)
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder and tell him about his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a niggas so cut-throat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Coulda stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go
Don't get it fucked up

[Justus (Kendrick Lamar):]
Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long
(All they wanna know is
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from nigga, huh?
Compton)

[Dr. Dre:]
Pst, this is about round for them
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific (the Pacific)
Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water
Listen, listen, listen
All you niggas swimming in the info
Gonna fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
Don't get it fucked up
Naw nigga, now everybody wanna visit
Tryna re-up that prescription (that prescription)
Yup, yeah, re-up
That's my nigga, water colors couldn't even paint the picture
They don't get the picture, fuck them
Yeah, drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
I'm the one that got they ear, for many years
I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear
My influence run deep like the ocean
Don't get it fucked up

[Justus (Kendrick Lamar):]
Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long
(All they wanna know is
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from nigga, huh?
Compton)

[Anderson .Paak:]
Feel's like you're drowning, don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over, shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (if you can't swim, if you can't swim)
Oh my God, where's a life guard when you need one?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking about no rapping, I was drinking for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No releasing me, I got the beast in me
I gotta holla, keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that bitch on auto pilot (Shit)
I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya, walking out your parents house
(Don't get it fucked up)
Probably got fucked up tryna park his tour bus
Not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A county zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga this is life in my aquarium
(Don't get it fucked up)

[Justus (Kendrick Lamar):]
Been away from home
Been away from home
All night long
(All they wanna know is
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from nigga, huh?
Compton)

[Marsha Ambrosius:]
This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at
Nigga, down in the deep water

[Anderson .Paak:]
Help me
Feels like you're drowning
I'm drowning
Help me
Help me, help me
Somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in
If you, if you can't swim)
Help me 
Help me, help me, help me
I can't, I can't breathe
I can't wait, help
(Where's a lifeguard when you need one?)
God please, please help me, please
Please help me, please help...
Please help, please...please...
