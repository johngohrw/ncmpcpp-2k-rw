Roll me over slowly, I've been drinkin' all night,
help me make a move, I can't stand the light.
Wake me, shake me, don't slam the door.
I ain't been so bad, I just can't recall.
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame,
lyin' on the floor I can't remember her name.
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.
What's goin onhere?

Went downtown, had a long way to go.
How I got there, well, I don't know.
Found myself sittin' in a west side bar,
tried to leave but I could not go far.
High class woman try'n to give me a line,
should have left early when I felt so fine.
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.
What's goin' on here?

When they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead.
I can't remember a thing I said.
Must have called the police to take me away.
They said, "Forty days", now I've got to pay.
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame,
lyin' on the floor I can't remember my name.
I can't get together while they're messin' with me,
keep on lookin' round, tell me where can I be.
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.
What's goin' on here?
