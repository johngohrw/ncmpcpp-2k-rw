Everytime I look into you it tears me up inside
Got a hunger for ya, woman, that just can't be denied
Don't tell me no, ain't my kind of answer
Don't tell me no, won't accept that answer

Makin' lots of money, honey, ain't what I call success
And I won't have what I need until you tell me yes
Don't tell me no - ain't my kind of answer
Don't tell me no - ain't no kind of answer

That's how much I want you
Like a good brew, like a fine wine
You improve with time and I want you, I love you
That's how much I need ya
You're a part of me, my philosophy, my reality
And I want you, that's how much I love you

Realize alibis ain't too wise
And they just won't cut this time
You're gonna give this boy a chance
'Cause he's apt to blow your mind
Don't tell me no, ain't my kind of answer
Don't tell me no, won't accept that answer
