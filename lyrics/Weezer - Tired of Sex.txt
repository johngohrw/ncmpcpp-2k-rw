I'm tired, so tired
I'm tired of having sex (so tired)
I'm spread so thin
I don't know who I am (who I am) 

Monday night I'm making Jen
Tuesday night I'm making Lynn
Wednesday night I'm making Jasmine
Oh, why can't I be making love come true? 

I'm beat, beet red
Ashamed of what I said (what I said)
I'm sorry, here I go
I know I'm a sinner
But I can't say no (say no) 

Thursday night I'm making Denise
Friday night I'm making Therese
Saturday night I'm making Louise
Oh, why can't I be making love come true? 

Tonight I'm down on my knees
Tonight I'm begging you please
Tonight, tonight, oh please
Oh, why can't I be making love come true?
