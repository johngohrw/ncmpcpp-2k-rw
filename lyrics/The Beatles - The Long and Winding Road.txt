The long and winding road, that leads, to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here, lead me to your door
The wild and windy night, that the rain, washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way

Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know, the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back, to the long winding road
You left me standing here a long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to your door

But still they lead me back to the long winding road
You left me standing here, a long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me wait), lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
