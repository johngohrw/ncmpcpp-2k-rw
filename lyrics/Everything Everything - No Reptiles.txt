[Falsetto whispering]

I was in the war
You were in the war

[Falsetto whispering]

I was on my knees
You were on your knees

And no reptiles - just soft boiled eggs in shirts and ties,
waiting for the flashing green man
quivering and wobbling just like all the eggs you know.

I'm going to kill a stranger,
So don't you be a stranger.

Oh baby it's alright, it's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair old enough to run.
Old enough to fire a gun.
Oh baby it's alright, it's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair old enough to run.
Old enough to fire a gun.
Oh baby it's alright, it's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair old enough to run.
Old enough to fire a gun.
Oh baby it's alright, it's alright to feel like a fat child in a pushchair old enough to run. (Oh)
Old enough to fire a gun.
Just give me this one night, just one night to feel like I might be on the right path - the path that takes me home. 
Wise enough to know myself.
Just give me this one night, just one night to feel like I might be on the right path. (Home)
Old enough to fire a gun.
Just give me this one night, just one night to feel like I might be on the right path - the path that takes me home. 
Wise enough to know myself.
Just give me this one night just one night to feel.
