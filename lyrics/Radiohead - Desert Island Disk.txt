Help as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light
Born of a light

The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine
With my spirit white
Totally alive
And my spirit light

Through an open doorway
Across a stream
To another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light
One I didn't know
Totally alive
Totally relieved

Waking up, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean

Standing on the edge of you
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
Are possible
