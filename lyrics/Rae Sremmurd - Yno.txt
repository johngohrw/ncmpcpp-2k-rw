[Hook: Slim Jimmy] 
Used to have to eat cold meals
Now a nigga off in gold seals
Countin' up money getting' chills
We some young niggas on for real

Tokyo drift through the hills
Used to have to walk no wheels
Now my whips for the crib
Young niggas on for real

Hunnid dolla bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real, aye
Hunnid dolla bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real, aye

Tokyo drift through the hills
Used to have to walk no wheels
Cameras outside my crib
Young niggas on for real

[Verse 1 - Swae Lee:] 
I showed them bitches better than I ever coulda told them bitches
Corduroy’s and Cartier’s back then muthafuckas never shared my vision
But what you ridin' in a space ship and where ya damage from Saudi Arabia
Oh you den came up and put ya niggas on
Now you gotta crown and a chinchilla on
A1 since day 1 we stayed down so we came up
Some of them niggas won't make it withcha they'll lose hope and they'll change up
I can see these niggas hatin' but as you can see the bad bitches love it
They ain't let us in the buildin' back then our names on the flyer if we comin, Rae Sremm
I tried to tell them I was gonna be something they used to look at me and laugh
All them hoes in the city don’t really love you unless you got some cash
That’s brand new paint nigga don't smudge it
Mufuckin pants cost 8 somethin'
That's my money so they can't say nothin
That’s my money so they won’t say nothin'

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy] 
Young niggas on pull up on yo ass unannounced in a foreign I don't know where I'm goin
Hit the gas can I hear the engine runnin no, livin' fast I ain't thinkin bout tomorrow, no
Used to be a nigga wantin’ 20 inch rims
Now we got accountants out here for Rae Sremm
All in the mall Neiman Marcus shoppin’
Came a long way from them outta street apartments
Everybody got a dream that they chasin', run to it
And everybody got a muthfuckin' hater
They wanna see your dreams burn into ashes
I can't wait to see they faces when I pass em
Boy you shoulda took a young nigga serious
Now young niggas on for real
They wasn’t fuckin with a young nigga then
They can't fuck with a young nigga still
I used to tell them I was gonna be somethin'
They used to look at me and laugh
And all them hoes in your city don't really love you untill you countin' cash, hunnids
That's brand new paint nigga, no smudgin
My mother fuckin' pants cost eight hunnid
That's my money, bitches can't say nothin'
That's my money bitch you can't have nothin'

[Verse 3: Big Sean] 
Look, moving in slo-mo but I still get away faster than you
So you never would know though
She's slowing it down just to ask for a photo
Just know that I'm fucking not maybe, for sure though
Soldiers on me like I'm fresh out the dojo
She think I'm beautiful chocolate skin coco
Don't get it fucked up, put your ass in a chokehold
Players only live once so I wear Polo
Polo Polo Polo Polo
My girl is from SoCal, my outfit from SoHo
And I got dough, that shit is stashed in the crib
And it won't leave the house like its fucking DiGiorno
Hell yea nigga that's all me
I’m from where big problems get handled with a small fee
Started with the squad now I got the whole team tight
Stuck to the plot, stuck to the script and I don't even screen write
