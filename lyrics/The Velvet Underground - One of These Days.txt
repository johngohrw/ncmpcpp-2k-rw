One of these days
Ain't it peculiar
Gonna look for me
And baby I'll be gone
One of these days
And it won't be long
You gonna call my name
And I'll be far gone

I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is if I can't stop dancing
And get my poor self off this bar room floor

One of these days
Ain't it peculiar
Babe you're gonna call my name
You now that I'll be gone (bye bye baby)

I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is if I can't stop dancing
And get my poor self off this bar room floor

One of these days
And it won't be long
You gonna call my name
And I'll be gone
You gonna call my name
And I'll be gone
You gonna call my name
And I'll be gone
