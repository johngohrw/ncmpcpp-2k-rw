I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Been breathing so hard we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard then lay you right on the grass

Give it to you over again
Over again over again
Over again

See making love underneath the cherry leaves
Babygirl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said aww baby oh baby
Up against the cherry tree
Babygirl
I'll give it to you naturally

Naturally ohh

See feeling like adam when he first found out this existed
Me and my eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good
And it's all free
And it's all you
And it's only me
Playing in the dirt
Wrestling myself inside you

Give it to you over again
Over again over again
Over again

Making love underneath the cherry leaves
Babygirl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said aww baby oh baby
Up against the cherry tree
Babygirl
I'll give it to you naturally

My cavewoman
I'm a caveman
Doing wild things
In a wild land
We keep going baby
We keep getting it baby
We'll get pebbles maybe
A couple bam bams
Bam bam bang bang
Girl your heart goes bam and bang
Feel my heart go go go
