Well, the clock says it's time to close now 
I guess I'd better go now 
I'd really like to stay here all night 
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes 
Street lights share their hollow glow 
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise 
Still one place to go 
Still one place to go 

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen 
Warm my mind near your gentle stove 
Turn me out and I'll wander baby 
Stumblin' in the neon groves 

Well, your fingers weave quick minarets 
Speak in secret alphabets 
I light another cigarette 
Learn to forget, learn to forget 
Learn to forget, learn to forget 

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen 
Warm my mind near your gentle stove 
Turn me out and I'll wander baby 
Stumblin' in the neon groves 

Well the clock says it's time to close now 
I know I have to go now 
I really want to stay here 
All night, all night, all night
