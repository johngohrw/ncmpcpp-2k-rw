(Crazy For You But) Not That CrazyThe Magnetic FieldsI built a ship with my own handsTo take us to the moonI took a pen in my own handAnd wrote you a hundred tunesNow I'm crazy for you but not that crazyI'm crazy for you but not that crazyI pretended you were JesusYou were just dying to save meI stood beneath your windowWith my ukuleleI made my yard a playgroundJust in case we had a babyNow I'm crazy for you but not that crazyI'm crazy for you but not that crazyI treated you like radiumI treated you like GodYou were my glass menagerieDid you not find that oddI dwelt within and went withoutAnd broke my virgin fleshI performed acts of devotionAs if you were Ganesh, but Now I'm crazy for you but not that crazyI'm crazy for you but not that crazy[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:%28Crazy_For_You_But%29_Not_That_Crazy ]
