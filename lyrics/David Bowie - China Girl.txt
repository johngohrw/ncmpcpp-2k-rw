I could escape this feeling 
with my China girl
I feel a wreck 
without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating
loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing 

I'm a mess
without my little China girl 
Wake up mornings where's my little China girl
I hear her heart's beating 
loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down

I feel a-tragic 
like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my china girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swasticas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says : sh-sh-shhh
