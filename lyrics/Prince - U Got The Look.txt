Here we are folks
The dream we all dream off
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have U got the look?
U walked in, I woke up
I never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
U got that look
Color U peach and black
Color me takin' aback
Crucial, I think I wantcha

You've got the look, you've got the hook
U sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get 2 rammin'
U got the look, U got the look

Look here
U got the look (U got the look)
U must'a took (U must'a took)
A whole hour just 2 make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected (everybody's inspected)
But U are a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)
Did I say an hour?
My face is red, I stand corrected (I stand corrected)

You've got the look, you've got the hook
U sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get 2 rammin'
U got the look, U got the look

(there's no girl to do)
Well here we are, ladies and gentlemen
The dream we all dream of (oh, please!)
Boy versus girl in the world series of love
Slammin'

U walked in (I walked in)
I woke up (U woke up)
I never seen a pretty girl look so tough' baby (baby)
U got that look, yes U do (yes U do)
Color U peach and black
Color me takin' aback, baby
Crucial, I think I wantcha

You've got the look, you've got the hook
U sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If your love is good, let's get 2 rammin' (now)
U got the look, U got the look
