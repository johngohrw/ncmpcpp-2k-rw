Take these dogs away from me
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah, Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah, Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah, Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah, Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)

Your life's a mystery, mine is an open book
If I could read your mind, I think I'd take a look
I'm not scared
Baby, I don't care

What have you got to hide? What do you need to prove?
You're always telling lies, and that's the only truth
I don't care
Baby, I'm not scared

Tonight the streets are full of actors
I don't know why
Oh, take these dogs away from me
Before they, they bite

What have you got to say of shadows in the past?
I thought that, if you paid, you'd keep them off our backs
Where do we have to be, so I can laugh and you'll be free?
I'd go anywhere
Baby, I don't care
I'm not scared
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah, Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) I'm not scared (Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)

Tonight the streets are full of actors
I don't know why
Oh, debarasse-moi de ces chiens
Avant qu'ils mordent
Avant qu'ils mordent
Tonight I fought and made my mind up
I know it's right
I know these dogs still snap around me
But I can, I can fight

If I was you, if I was you
I wouldn't treat me the way you do
If I was you, if I was you
I wouldn't treat me the way you do - you
If I was you, if I was you
I wouldn't treat me the way you do
If I was you, if I was you
I wouldn't treat me the way you do - you

(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) I'm not scared (Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) Baby, I don't care (Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah)
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) I'd go anywhere (Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) 
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) Baby, I'm not scared (Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) 
J'ai pas peur
J'ai pas peur
(Ah Ah Ah Ah - Ah Aah Aah) I'm not scared
