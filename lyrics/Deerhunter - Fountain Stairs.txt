I forgot my book
At the fountain stairs
At a chapter on symmetry
Nobody cares

And I had a smoke
While I traced the squares
Put my finger to concrete
Felt the autumn air

When I look around
I can feel it spinning
Feet on the ground
Head on the ceiling

Sun on my shirt
Sweat on my hands
All falling in retrograde
Cancel all my plans

And I had to look
At the marching band
Skip across the pavement
Nobody's there

When I look around
I can feel it spinning
Feet on the ground
Head on the ceiling
