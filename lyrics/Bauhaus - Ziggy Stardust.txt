Ziggy played guitar 
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly 
And the Spiders From Mars 
He played it left hand 
But made it too far 
Became the special man 
Then we were Ziggy's band 

Ziggy really sang 
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hair-do 
Like some cat from Japan 
He could lick 'em by smiling 
He could leave them to hang 
Came on so loaded man 
Well hung and snow-white tan 

So where were the Spiders 
While the flies tried to break our balls 
Just the beer light to guide us 
So we bitch about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands 

Ziggy played for time 
Jiving us that we were voodoo 
But the kids were just crass 
He was the nazz, with God-given ass 
He took it all too far 
But boy, could he play guitar 

Making love with his ego 
Ziggy sucked up into his mind 
Like a leper messiah 
When the kids had killed the man 
We had to break up the band 

Now Ziggy played guitar
