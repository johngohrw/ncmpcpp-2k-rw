Yeah, so, um... wait a second -
Yeah, so, um... wait a second -
Yeah, so, um... wait a second -
Yeah, so, um... wait a second -

Sold your liver but you're still feeling the red
Sold my feelings now I'm hanging by a thread

Bad
And it's creeping it's way through my windows
And it's slithering under my door
And it's in my peripheral vision
And it's burrowing up under my floor
And it's whispering into my eardrums
And it's telling me that I want more

But I'm coming alive
I'm happening now
I'm coming alive
I'm happening now

I'm coming alive
I'm happening now
I'm coming alive
I'm happening now

And that eureka moment hits you like a cop car
And you wake up just head and shoulders in a glass jar
You clear your throat you raise your eyebrow but you don't say
There's something wrong but it's okay if we're still getting paid

Yeah you're ravenous you're champing at the bit
Just a cog next to a cog next to a pit
I would burn to break away and rest my ears
No more lightning, no more solace in arrears

Bad
And it's creeping it's way through my windows
And it's slithering under my door
And it's in my peripheral vision
And it's burrowing up under my floor
And it's whispering into my eardrums
And it's telling me that I want more

But I'm coming alive
I'm happening now
I'm coming alive
I'm happening now

I'm coming alive
I'm happening now
I'm coming alive
I'm happening now

And that eureka moment hits you like a cop car
And you wake up just head and shoulders in a glass jar
You clear your throat you raise your eyebrow but you don't say
There's something wrong but it's okay if we're still getting paid

But I'm coming alive
I'm happening now
I'm coming alive
I'm happening now

I'm coming alive
I'm happening now
I'm coming alive
I'm happening now

And that eureka moment hits you like a cop car
And you wake up just head and shoulders in a glass jar
You clear your throat you raise your eyebrow but you don't say
There's something wrong but it's okay if we're still getting paid

But I'm coming alive
Cough cough
