For We Are The King Of The BoudoirThe Magnetic FieldsShould time allow us to describe our prowessIt would be quite hard to overrateFor we are the king of the boudoir old thing and the king doesn't like to waitOne tryst with me and you'll be spinning like a gyroscopeOne tryst with me and you'll be PopeShould modesty allow us to describe our prowesslessnesslessness'Twould be hard to overstateFor we are the king of the boudoir it's true and the king doesn't like to waitOne kiss from me and you'll be overjoyed and overawedOne kiss from me and you'll see GodFor we are the king of the boudoir we are and the king doesn't like to wait[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:For_We_Are_The_King_Of_The_Boudoir ]
