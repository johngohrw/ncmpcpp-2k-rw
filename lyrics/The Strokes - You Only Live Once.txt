Ooooooo-ooooo-ooooooh 
Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others they seem so very nice nice nice nice, oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong, oh no

Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like, oh
Twenty ways to see the world, oh
Twenty ways to start a fight, oh

Oh don't, don't, don't get up, I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you, baby 'cause I'm through
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you

Ooooooo-ooooo-ooooooh 
Oh, men don't notice what they got
Women think of that a lot
One thousand ways to please your man, oh
Not even one requires a plan, I know

Countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose, oh no
One stubborn way to turn your back, oh
This I've tried and now refuse, oh

Oh don't, don't, don't get up, I can't see the sunshine
Oh, I'll be waiting for you, baby 'cause I'm through
Sit me down, shut me up
I'll calm down and I'll get along with you, alright

Shut me up, shut me up up up up up
And I'll get along with you
