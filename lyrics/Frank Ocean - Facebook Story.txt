I was just telling that I got this girl before
And I was together since 3 years
And em, I was not even cheating on her or what
And Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her
And she told me like "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, made no sense
So I say "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She started to be crazy
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, it's over
And I can't believe it
It is crazy because I like her
I'm in front of you, I'm every day
Here in your house
That's like jealousy
Pure jealousy for nothing
You know
Virtual thing
