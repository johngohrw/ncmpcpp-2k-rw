Quiet
I am sleeping
in here
We need a little hope 

For years
I've been sleeping
Helpless
Couldn't tell a soul

Be ashamed
Of the mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Silent
Metal mercies
Castrate
Boys to the bone

Jesus
Are you listening?
Up there
To anyone at all

We are the fossils
The relics of our time
We mutilate the meanings
So they're easy to deny

Be ashamed
Of the mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I am sleeping
Quiet
I don't trust you
I can't hear you

Be ashamed
Of the mess you've made
My eyes never forget, you see
Behind me

Behind me
The grace of falling snow
Cover up everything you know
Come save me from the awful sound
Of nothing
