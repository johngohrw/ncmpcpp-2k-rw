Raw, no fuckin' filter, crooked needle, hot head
Raw, no fuckin' filter, crooked needle, hot head

Self-inflicted
What'd you tell them?
I just told 'em hell's existence
But you know me, don't nobody
Know my business
My presence flog your confidence
Who want a brand new complex?
Now on, I'll call you, go fetch
Self-inflicted
What'd you tell them?
I just told 'em hell's existence
But you know me, don't nobody
Know my business
Get used to fetch, I'll shoot, you catch
I snap, you come, I don't call you back
Act natural, my style attack

Give it out, give it out, give it out, give it out, give it out, give it out
Dive bomber, dive bomber
Clip a hundred doves like a bald-headed rasta
Clot of the dot, got a head a piranha
Give it up, give it up, give it up
My...
My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
My cobra head draped in mota
My cobra head draped in mota

My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
Blink and you're over
Wouldn't shut the fuck up, answered for their behavior
Cleft palate creator
Morgue head forsaker
Phallus cloud, call me vapor
My cobra head draped in ebola
My cobra head draped in mota
My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
Blink and you're over
Wouldn't shut the fuck up, answered for their behavior
Cleft palate creator
Morgue head forsaker
Phallus cloud, crown me vapor
My cobra head draped in mota
Hooded regime like ebola
Blink and you're over
Wouldn't shut the fuck up, answered for their behavior
Cleft palate creator
Morgue head forsaker
Phallus cloud, crown me vapor
