Mommy's in the kitchen cooking up something good
And daddy's on the sofa, pride of the neighborhood
My brother's in the ballet, it seems he's got it set
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette

Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go
Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go

Daddy's in the basement cooking up something fine
While rick's out on the pavement, flipping it for dimes
If there's anything redeeming I haven't seen it yet
And I'm still up at midnight chewing nicorette

Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go
Ooh, when life moves this slowly
Ooh, just try and let it go
