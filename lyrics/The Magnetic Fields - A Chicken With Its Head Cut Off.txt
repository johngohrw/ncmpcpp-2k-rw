A Chicken With Its Head Cut OffThe Magnetic FieldsEligible, not too stupidIntelligable and cute as CupidKnowledgable but not always rightSalvageable and free for the nightWell, my heart's running 'round like a chicken with its head cut offAll around the barnyard, falling in and out of lovePoor thing's blind as a bat, getting up, falling down, getting upWho'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off?Woah, nelly!My wife doesn't understand meMany dozens hope to land meI'm for free love and I'm in free fallThis could be love or nothing at allBut my heart's running 'round like a chicken with its head cut offAll around the barnyard, falling in and out of loveThe poor thing's blind as a bat, getting up, falling down, getting upWho'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off?We don't have to be stars exploding in the night, or electric eels under the coversWe don't have to be anything quite so unreal, let's just be loversWell, my heart's running 'round like a chicken with its head cut offAll around the barnyard, falling in and out of loveThe poor thing's blind as a bat, getting up, falling down, getting upWho'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off?It ain't pretty[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:A_Chicken_With_Its_Head_Cut_Off ]
