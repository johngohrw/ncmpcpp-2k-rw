Like the brutal autumn sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for a second time
Each fucking doubt I make, unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you
Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know what I always think I'm bind by
You never accept defeat or let it slide
But I have no voice if I don't speak my mind
My weakness is the source of all my pride, I'll tell you why

Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you
Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to
