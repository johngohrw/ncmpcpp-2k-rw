If we can't get along we oughta be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart
Set me free - sign my release
I'm tired of being the villain of the peace

You been giving me a bad time
Tell me what I'd do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
Sayin' things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you

You only get one life - this I know
I wanna get my licks in now before I go
The fire of love is dead and cold
I gotta satisfy the hunger in my soul

And you been giving me a bad time
Tell me what I'd do
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
Sayin' things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time
Honey when it comes to you
