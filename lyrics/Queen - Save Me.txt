It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you,
How I cried.....
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
"I'll love you 'til I die"

Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories,
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?.....
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I'll love you 'til I die
