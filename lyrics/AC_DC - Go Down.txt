Ruby, Ruby where you been so long
Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby since you been gone
Ain't no one I know
Do it good as you
Lickin' on that lickin' stick
The way you do
You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
Give you a tip
It ain't just the way you speak
You know it's just the way you go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Mary, Mary you're the one for me
And the way you hum
Sting me like a bumble bee
I'll be round to see you 'bout
'bout half past ten
Ain't felt this good
Since I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that ya love to taste
On those lovely lips
So go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Baby rub it on
Ya know it's sticky and it's sweet
And it's been so long
Ain't no one else
Got a touch like you
I let you do the things to me I let no other woman do
Feels good
Feels good
Oh yeah
You do it like you should
Oh yeah
I love you so much
Make me glad I'm a man
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down
