It was only last June when her old man ran away
She couldn't stop crying 'cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
It was 10:35 on a lonely friday night
She was standin' by the bar
Hmm, she was lookin' alright, yeah
I asked if she wanted 2 dance
And she said all she wanted was a good man
And wanted 2 know if I thought I was qualified, yeah
And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
I may be qualified 4 a one night stand
But I could never take the place of your man

It hurt me so bad when she told me
with tears in her eyes (tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had and now she wanted 2 die
He left her with a baby and another one on the way
She couldn't stop cryin'
Cause she knew he was gone 2 stay
She asked me if we could be friends
And I said, oh, honey baby that's a dead end
U know and I know that we wouldn't be satisfied

And I said, baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
U wouldn't be satisfied with a one night stand
And I could never take the place of your man

Yeah, yeah, the place of your man
