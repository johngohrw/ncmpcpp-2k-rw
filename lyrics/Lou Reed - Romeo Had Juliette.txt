Caught between the twisted stars
The plotted lines the faulty map
That brought Columbus to New York

Betwixt between the East and West
He calls on her wearing a leather vest
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt

A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car

Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell

And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo

Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail

He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell

Outside the streets were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored

I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz

Brother give me another tote
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught

This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin'
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street

And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo

I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
"It's hard to give a shit these days"

Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome

The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone
