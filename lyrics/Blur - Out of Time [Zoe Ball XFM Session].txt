Where's the love song?
To set us free
Too many people down
Everything turning the wrong way around
And I don't know what love will be
But if we start dreaming now
Lord knows we'll never leave the clouds

[CHORUS:]
And you've been so busy lately
that you haven't found the time
To open up your mind
And watch the world spinning gently out of time

Feel the sunshine on your face
It's in a computer now
Gone to the future, way out in space

[REPEAT CHORUS (x2)]

Tell me I'm not dreaming but are we out of time?
(We're) out of time

Out of time [x4]
