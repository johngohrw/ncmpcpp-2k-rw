I'm back 
I'm back in the saddle again 
I'm back 
I'm back in the saddle again 

Ridin' into town alone 
By the light of the moon 
I'm looking for ole' Sukie Jones 
She crazy horse saloon 
Barkeep gimme a drink 
That's when she caught my eye 
She turned to give me a wink 
That'd make a grown man cry 

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back 

Umm...come easy, go easy 
Alright 'til the rising sun 
I'm calling all the shots tonight 
I'm like a loaded gun 
Peelin' off my boots and chaps 
I'm saddle sore 
Four bits gets you time in the racks 
I scream for more 

Fools' gold out of their mines 
The girls are soaking wet 
No tongue's drier than mine 
I'll come when I get back 

I'm back in the saddle again 
I'm back 
I'm back in the saddle again 
I'm riding, I'm loading up my pistol 
I'm riding, I really got a fistful 
I'm riding, I'm shining up my saddle 
I'm riding, this snake is gonna rattle 

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back 

Ridin' high 
Ridin' high 
Ridin' high already
