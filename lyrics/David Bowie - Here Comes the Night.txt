Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)

I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her 
like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

[CHORUS]
Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept 
the fact she's chosen him 
And simply let them be?

[CHORUS]

Oh she's with him 
they're turning down the lights
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes 
and telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

[CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)]
