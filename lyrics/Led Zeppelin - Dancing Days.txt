Dancing days are here again as the summer evenings grow 
I got my flower, I got my power, I got a woman who knows. 

[CHORUS]
I said it's alright. You know it's alright - I guess it's all in my heart 

You'll be my only, my one and only. Is that the way it should start? 

Crazy ways are evident, In the way that you're wearing your clothes 
Sippin'' booze is precedent as the evening starts to glow. 

[CHORUS]

I told your mamma I'd get you home but I didn't tell her I had no car 
I saw a lion he was standing alone with a tadpole in a jar. 

[CHORUS]

Dancing days are here again as the summer evening grows 
You are my flower, you are my power 
You are my woman who knows. 

[CHORUS]
