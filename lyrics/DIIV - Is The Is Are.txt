You ain't the first to realize
You ain't the first to look in my eyes

Over my head and positive
I have a gift that I’ll never give

You ain't the first
You ain't the first

Last time I walked down this street
I walked down this street
I wanted to die

Die

Now I’m fighting
I feel like I’m fighting
I feel like I’m
Fighting for my life

Life
