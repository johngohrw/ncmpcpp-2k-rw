Oooh Ma Oooh Pa 
Must the show go on 
Oooh Pa take me home 
Oooh Ma let me go 
There must be some mistake 
I didn't mean to let them 
Take away my soul 
Am I too old is it too late 
Oooh Ma Oooh Pa 
Where has the feeling gone? 
Oooh Ma Oooh Pa 
Will I remember the songs? 
Oooooh aah the show must go on.
