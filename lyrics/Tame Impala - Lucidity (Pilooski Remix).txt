I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up but I wouldn't know what to say

Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, it's hard to tell, it breaks down
There is a will, there is a way

Wondering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck fizzle or I might just float away

And we'll go running off tonight
High above, where we won't even need to reach the sky
My love, oh, there will be a change in the air
Nobody will be anybody else
Lucidity, come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh, where we'll go, tiptoe
Tread boldly right down to the lair
