Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting for the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western Way
Build your muscles as your body decays.

Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the hammer to fall.

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
(Oh no! Oh no!)
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
(Oh no!)
Baby, now your struggle's all vain.

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the hammer toâ€”hammer to fall.

Yeah! Yes.
Let's get on the floor!
Yeah! Hammer!
You know
Hammer to fall!

Yeah!

I've been waiting for the hammer to fall!
While you're waiting for the hammer to fall.

Give it to me one more time!
