So I just came out the booth to God damn to hear this, you hear this shit right here? And my niggas, niggas just sayin', bruh I just told him the same shit. Them niggas just told these girls that he do it all by the sink. It's crazy, cray-cray, I did though, you know what I'm sayin'? With a golden shovel lifestyle, AP plus a Rollie bezel on another level

I say bitch what is you thinkin', we are the blinkin'
Bitch ass on me and I got rank and I'm steady rankin'
Better stop listenin' to these hoes 'fore you start shrinkin'
I know I'm a blood, I'm a gang banger
I know where the bitch but I'm still singin' too
Mothafuck the rest, they ainâ€™t really bangin'
I got the real hitters with me and they bangers
You can't find 'em on no camera but they no namin'
Washin' powder bae on Tide, I've been up all night
Me and bae Bonnie Clyde, everything we do right
Love her vibe, love her vibe, she make me feel so nice
She 100, the first day we met she let me fuck all night

Ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work baby do the work
Tonight baby do the work baby do the work
Tonight I wanna chill all you gotta do is Perc
If you want it you gotta earn it
You gotta earn it, you gotta earn-earn-earn it
If you wanna be with me you gotta earn it
Alright, earn-earn-earn it, aye

I can tell that you want it baby, I can tell that you need it
I can tell that you suckin', fuckin', I can tell you a demon
I can tell you a big torrie baby, I can keep your secret
I'ma show you how to win without cheatin', I'ma show you how to beat it
Drop top in a [?] with a big tall demon
I elect you to feed me, I'ma lead you to victory
Like shoutout to Stevie but these niggas not seein' me
I'm a big daddy [?] and these niggas not beatin' me
Aye, I'm scared to trust you, I'm scared you'll trick me
I done drive by in a foreign car but they're still tryna eat me
Put 60,000 on my mama ring and it ain't even come out of Tiffany's
I can tell you how to get the money but you just gotta listen to me

Ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work baby do the work
Tonight baby do the work baby do the work
Tonight I wanna chill all you gotta do is Perc
If you want it you gotta earn it
You gotta earn it, you gotta earn-earn-earn it
If you wanna be with me you gotta earn it
Alright, earn-earn-earn it, aye

I picked my diamonds out a honey tree
