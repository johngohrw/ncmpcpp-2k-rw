As I reach for a peach 
Slide a rind down behind 
the sofa in San Tropez 
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand 
Riding a wave in the wake of an old Sedan 
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness 
Scratched by the sand that fell from our love 
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling 
If you're alone I'll come home 
Backwards and home bound 
The pidgeon the dove 
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane 
Owning a home with no silver spoon 
I'm drinking champaigne like a big tycoon 
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather 
I'll gather my far flung thoughts together 
Speeding away on a wind to a new day 
If your alone I'll come home 
And I pause for a while 
By a country style 
And listen to things they say 
Digging for gold in the hoe in my hand 
Hoping they'll take a look at the way things stand 
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea 
I hear your soft voice calling to me 
Making a date for later by phone 
if you're alone I'll come home
