How Fucking RomanticThe Magnetic FieldsHow fucking romanticAll the stars are outTwinkling twinkling twinklingAnd fluttering aboutWhat a tacky sunsetWhat a vulgar moonPlay another charmingRogers and hart tuneHow fucking romanticMust we really waltz?Drag another clicheHowling from the vaultsLove you obviouslyLike you really careEven though you treat meLike a dancing bearToss your bear a goldfishAs he cycles byDon't forget to feed yourBear or it'll die[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:How_Fucking_Romantic ]
