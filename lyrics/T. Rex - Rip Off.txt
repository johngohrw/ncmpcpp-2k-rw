In the moonlight
Fighting with the night
It's a rip-off
Kissing all the slain
I'm bleeding in the rain
Such a rip-off

Rocking in the nude
I'm feeling such a dude
It's a rip-off
Dancing in the dark
With the tramps in the Park
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off

See your baby's stud
Sliding in my mud
It's a rip-off
Bleached on the beach
I want to tickle your peach
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off

See the girl in dance
In her man-skin pants
Such a rip-off
Terraplane Tommy
Wants to bang your gong
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off

Gypsy girl's good
People treat her like a fool
It's a rip-off
The President's weird
He's got burgundy beard
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off

I'm the King of the highway
I'm the Queen of the hop
You should see me
At the Governor's ball
Doing the rip-off bop

I'm a social person
I'm the creature in disguise
There's a man with a whip
On his silver lip
Living inside my eyes

I'm the cat from the alley
I'm the fleetfoot voodoo man
There's very little that's ever said
All of which I understand

Caught like skunk
In space and time
It's a rip-off
If it's hers
Well it must be mine
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off

Dancing in the nude
Feeling such a dude
It's a rip-off
Mountings of the moon
Remind me of my spoon
It's a rip-off
Such a rip-off
