Regret! Regret!
Regret! Regret!

First you'll see me on the news then never again
Regret! Regret!
I'm rolling in my grave
Regret! Regret!
Feeling like a grenade
Regret! Regret!
Maybe you're the coldest
Regret! Regret!
If you never felt it
Regret! Regret!
Maybe you're the luckiest
Regret! Regret!
If you never did it
Regret! Regret!

But did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you imagine it
(But did you imagine it)
In a different way?

Did you ever watch your life slide out of your hands?
Regret! Regret!
You wish it never had
Regret! Regret!
But all of that's in the past
Regret! Regret!
Maybe I'm a human?
Regret! Regret!
Trying to click undo, man
Regret! Regret!
Or maybe I'm automaton
Regret! Regret!
Oh how'd it all go so wrong
Regret! Regret!

But did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you imagine it
(But did you imagine it)
In a different way?
Did you think that everything
Everything would change?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?

Regret! Regret!
Hahahahaha
Regret! Regret!
Maybe you're the luckiest
Regret! Regret!
If you never felt it
Regret! Regret!

But did you imagine it
In a different way?
Did you imagine it
(But did you imagine it)
In a different way?
Did you think that everything
Everything would change?
Did you imagine it
In a different way?

Regret! Regret!
