Baby salt baby tears.
Go catch me under the window!
Go catch me under the doorway!

Baby salt feeding tears.
Go cath me under the window!
Go catch me under the doorway!

Why tears?
So slow.

You're the weight of the moon.
You're the perfect story.
I can see you drinking my thoughts.
This plane is taking off.

Why tears?
So slow.
