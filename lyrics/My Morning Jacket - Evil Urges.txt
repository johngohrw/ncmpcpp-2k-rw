Honey, it's rotten and they got us so scared
Thinking there's some evil waiting under vain
Whooo! I made a nasty decision
To love whoever I want just-a whenever I can

Things they're saying-- 
Evil urges baby; they're just part of the human way
It ain't evil baby, if ya ain't hurting anybody
Evil urges baby; they're now part of the human way
It ain't evil baby, if ya ain't hurting anybody, anybody

It's all the same, we're tired of waiting, come on then
And dedicate your love to any woman or man
No racial boundary lines, no social subdivisions
If you want it, you can

Well we're not saying, I'm not saying that I want it someday
And we're not saying, I'm not saying that I want it somehow
Well we're not saying, I'm not saying that I want it someday, somehow
Woo, I'm ready it for now (I'm ready for it now)

I'm ready it for now (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready it for now (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready it for, ah (I'm ready for it now)
I'm ready for it now

Things they're saying-- 
Evil urges baby; they're part of the human way
It ain't evil baby, if ya ain't hurting anybody
Evil urges baby come on; bad is all the same, come on now 
It ain't evil baby, if it ain't hurting anybody anybody

Evil urges baby, they're part of the human way
It ain't evil baby, 'cause ya ain't hurting anybody anybody
