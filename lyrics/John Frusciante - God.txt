So each day would be new I build you to sleep 
That's the idea of dying but you'll just have to see 
You can do what you want or so you think 
But til you stop all your thoughts 
you are ties to your surroundings 
When the fog spreads out in the rainy season 
It comes from my insides 
When the thunderous lightning strikes down 
You're seeing your real I 
People 
You blaspheme my name 
But still I love you 
Still I love you 
I love you just the same 
I hear all your prayers because I'm each one of you 
Creations not something I did 
It's something that I do 
The reason for the bad is so there'd be such thing as good 
Oh I'd do anything for you 
You all know I would 
Be for me 
Be for me 
Be for me 
Before me 
Before me 
Before me 
You know that I try to repair and repay 
As life goes by a thousand times 
It gets a little btetter 
All is belief, All is belief, All is belief, All is belief
