Way way down a hole, there's no feeling,
Cause when you're so far below the floor, everything's a ceiling.
We dug it down as deep as we could just like we planned it,
But when you climbed out you pulled the ladder and it left me stranded

So what am I supposed to do?
I'm calling out to you
But you're miles away, it's true
Digging with someone new

So far down in this hole, there's little daylight.
I feel the shards of the midday sun and then it's black as midnight.
The only stars I see in the sky, they don't move me.
Cause they've all been dead for millions of years, they're just light diffusing.

And the constellations move and the brightest point is full,
But every telescope you see, was pointed only at you.

And I've got nowhere to go except further below,
So I keep digging.
And it gets darker everyday,
But I see no other way than just committing.

And if the earth is as round as they say
Then I won't find another place
From where I break back through
It's farther away from you
It's farther away from you

So what am I supposed to do?
I'm calling out to you
But you're miles away, it's true
Digging with someone new

So what am I supposed to do?
I'm calling out to you
But you're miles away, it's true
Digging with someone new 
Digging with someone new 
Digging with someone new
