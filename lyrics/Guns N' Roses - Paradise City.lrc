[Chorus 2x:]
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Just a' urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case
So buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Ragz to richez or so they say
Ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
It's all a gamble
When it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' their time

[Chorus:]
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette, but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

[Chorus:]
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

So far away [4x]

Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said—
Turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losin' my mind—"Are you blind?"
I've seen it all a million times

[Chorus 2x:]
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

Home [2x]
I wanna go [2x]
Oh won't you please take me home.
I wanna see,
Oh won't you please take me home.

[Chorus:]
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down
To the paradise city
Where the grass is green
And the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
