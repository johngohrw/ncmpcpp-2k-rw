When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
If I die, all I know is I'm a motherfucking legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour
Got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas
Now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish
Make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'ont know who we are
Fuck em all, they only pussy niggas shooting at the star
Right or wrong, I'm a write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a motherfucking legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D I'm the holy one
Yeah, you know what's up
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

When I pull up on a nigga
Tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words
Watch a nigga backtrack
All I know, if I die, I'm a motherfucking legend
It's too late for my city
I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm the one...
