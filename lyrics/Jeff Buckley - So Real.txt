Love, let me sleep tonight on you couch 
And remember the smell of the fabric 
Of your simple city dress 

Oh... that was so real 

We walked around til the moon got full like a plate 
The wind blew an invocation and i fell asleep at the gate 
And I never stepped on the cracks 'cause i thought i'd hurt my mother 
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under 
Pulled me under 

Oh... that was so real 

I love you, but i'm afraid to love you 
I love you, but i'm afraid to love you
