Grand CanyonThe Magnetic FieldsIf I was the Grand CanyonI'd echo everything you sayBut I'm just me I'm only meAnd you used to love me that waySo you know how to love me that wayIf I was Paul BunyanI'd carry you so far awayBut I'm just me I'm only meAnd you used to love me that waySo you know how to love me that way[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Grand_Canyon ]
