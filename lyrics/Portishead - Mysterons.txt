Inside your pretending
Crimes have been swept aside
Somewhere where they can forget 

Divine upper reaches
Still holding on
This ocean will not be grasped
All for nothing

Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want

[INSTRUMENTAL]

Refuse to surrender
Strung out until ripped apart
Who dares, dares to condemn
All for nothing

Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
Did you really want
