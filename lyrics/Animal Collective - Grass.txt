Well, I was walking on feet just like my fathers
And my knees were trying to reach you at your mother's
'Cause my nose was screaming that you smelled like a lover
But my hands were happy to treat you like a brother, then

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?
We do

Pow! Pow!
Now! Now!

I've been into the plants and simple treasures
And I sew patches on pants and I'll get pleasure
And I don't make particular plans 'cause they don't matter
If you keep on foolin' in bed with my sleeping patterns, and

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?
We do

Pow! Pow!
Now! Now!

What's with all the changes since the time I was aware
It's like the apple eating people that we once were aren't there
Did they empty out their pockets and debase their younger faces
And you must make sure you're happy when you leave your summer places

Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat
I'd be sad if you're rejected from my hip bone and my knee
If I sailed away from continents and touched my lover's hair there
Then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

Pretty little femur sitting in my cherry dream boat
I'd be sad if you're rejected from my hip bone and my knee
If I sailed away from continents and touched my lover's hair
Then you'd be very happy if I touched her there

I was very nervous how I felt in there
I was very cautious what'd you say
Hey there

Would you like to see me often?
Though you don't need to see me often
'Cause I'd like to see you often
Though I don't need to see you often

We do the dance up on the plains
Then I'll shake-shake your shoulders
You push me down into the grains
Who rubs our noses in the night?
We do

Pow! Pow!
Now! Now!
