Hold on John , John Hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna win the fight

Hold on Yoko , Yoko hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna make the flight

When you'r by yourself
And there's no-one else
You just tell yourself
To hold on

Hold on world , world hold on
It's gonna be alright
You gonna see the light

When you're one
really one
You get things done
like they've never been done
So hold on
