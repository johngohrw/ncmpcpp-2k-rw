They tell us that we lost our tails
Evolving up from little snails
I say it's all just wind in sails

We are not whole

I got a rhyme that comes in a riddle
O-Hi-O
What's round on the end and high in the middle?
O-Hi-O

Together now, God made man 
But he used a monkey to do it
Apes in the plan 
We're all here to prove it
I can walk like an ape
Talk like an ape
I can do what a monkey do
God made man 
But a monkey supplied the glue
