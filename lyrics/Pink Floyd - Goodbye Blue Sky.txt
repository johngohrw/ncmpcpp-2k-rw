[Childs voice:]
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Oooooooo ooo ooo ooooh 
Did you see the frightened ones 
Did you hear the falling bombs 
Did you ever wonder 
Why we had to run for shelter 
When the promise of a brave new world 
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky 
Oooooooo ooo ooooo oooh 
Did you see the frightened ones 
Did you hear the falling bombs 
The flames are all long gone 
But the pain lingers on 
Goodbye blue sky 
Goodbye blue sky 
Goodbye 
Goodbye
