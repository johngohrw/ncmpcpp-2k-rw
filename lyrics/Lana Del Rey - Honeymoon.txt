We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go cause truly there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used little bullet car if we choose

Mr. Born to lose

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs and fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town had neither fought nor found you

Everything you do is elusive, too, even your honey dew

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
