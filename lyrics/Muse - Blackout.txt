Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This love's too good to last
And I'm too old to dream

Don't grow up too fast
And don't embrace the past
This life's too good to last
And i'm too young to care

Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This life could be the last
And we're too young to see
