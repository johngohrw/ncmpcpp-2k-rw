When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry,
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
I wish I was special,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special.
[Clean version:] You're so very special.

[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I want to have control,
I want a perfect body,

I want a perfect soul,
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special,
[Clean version:] You're so very special,
I wish I was special.

[Chorus:]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

Oh, oh

She's running out again,
She's running out...
She run run run run...
Run...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
[Album version:] You're so fucking special,
[Clean version:] You're so very special,
I wish I was special...
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here.
