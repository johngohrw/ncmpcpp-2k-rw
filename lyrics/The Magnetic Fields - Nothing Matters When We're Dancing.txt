Nothing Matters When We're DancingThe Magnetic FieldsDance with me my old friend Once before we go Let's pretend this song won't end And we never have to go home And we'll dance among the chandeliers And nothing matters when we're dancing In tat or tatters you're entrancing Be we in Paris or in LansingNothing matters when we're dancing You've never been more beautiful Your eyes like two full moons Than here in this poor old dance hall Among the dreadful tunes The awful songs we don't even hearAnd nothing matters when we're dancing In tat or tatters you're entrancing Be we in Paris or in LansingNothing matters when we're dancing[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Nothing_Matters_When_We%27re_Dancing ]
