And so, you built a life on trust
Though it starts, with love and lust
And when your house, begins to rust
Oh, it's just, metal and dust

We argue, we don't fight
We argue, we don't fight

And all foundation that we made
Built to last, they disintegrate
And when your house begins to rust
Oh, it's just, metal and dust

We argue, we don't fight
Stay awake to the middle of the night
Stay awake to the middle of the night
We argue, we don't fight
Stay awake to the middle of the night
Stay awake to the middle of the night
We don't argue
We argue, we don't fight
Stay awake to the middle of the night
Stay awake to the middle of the night
We don't argue
We argue, we don't fight
Stay awake to the middle of the night
Stay awake to the middle of the night
We don't argue
We don't argue
We don't argue
