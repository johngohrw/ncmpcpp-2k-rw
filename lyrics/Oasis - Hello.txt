I don't feel as if I know you
You take up all my time
The days are long and the night will throw you away
Coz the sun don't shine
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play 

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello 

There ain't no sense in feeling lonely
They got no faith in you
But I've got a feeling you still owe me
So wipe the shit from your shoes
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play 

We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away
And it's never gonna be the same
Cos the years are following by like the rain
And it's never gonna be the same
'Til the life I knew comes to my house and says
Hello 

Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
It's good to be back
