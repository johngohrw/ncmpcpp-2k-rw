You are my whiskey
I'll make you mine
I can just taste it

All of these shot boys think I'm divine
But I don't want to waste it

They're like a second, but you're like a day
Yeah I used to hit it then go on my way
Boy I get so tipsy with you on my mind
Yeah I like the whisky with my nursery rhyme

[Chorus:]
Throw it back
Sip it slow

You're on the top shelf
And I'm looking up
Perfectly crafted

Bartender tell me
What's in that cup
Yeah I got to have it

I know you won't burn when I drink my glass
I know how to drink it I learn pretty fast
So take me to bed, babe, and I'll close my eyes
Yeah I like the whisky with my lullaby

[Chorus]
