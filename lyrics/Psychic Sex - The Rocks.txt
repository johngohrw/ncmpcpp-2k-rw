(One time) We passed in line
(Two times) We shared a sigh
(Three times) We talked of rain
(Four times) We fucked again
(One time) We laughed it off
(Two times) We kept it soft
(Three times) You screamed so loud I swear they could hear it in the back of the hotel

I got the rocks, so let’s dig in
I got the whiskey again
I got my rocks, I got my in

(One time) We got a drink
(Two times) We shared a wink
(Three times) We sat around
(Four times) I had to lie down
(One time) We laughed it off
(Two times) We kept it soft
(Three times) We lied and said I want it again, I wanna fuck until I drop dead

I got the rocks, so let’s dig in
I got the whiskey again
I got my rocks, I got my in

Oh no! Please no more!
It’s too much for a boy to ask for!
(Take it! Take it!) One last time!
If we do it again, I might just die!
(So what?!) You’re very persuasive
But I’m afraid, that a few more drinks
Might be all I need to fade away
