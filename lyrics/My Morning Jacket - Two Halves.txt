Remember when you were seventeen
You's goin' crazy, you know what I mean
It wasn't that long ago
In the grand scheme of things
It wasn't that long ago
You think you're so much smarter now

Twenty one everything stays in place
Forty one some things start to fade
Well, when you're so young (so young), you wanna be older (so young)
And when you're older, you want the body you have now

I believe in a perfect world
You rule your own universe
The only gun you'll ever need will be in your brain
The only gun you'll need is in your hands

You want this now you want that
Can't have it all you should enjoy what you have
But I know what you want (what you want)
Well I know what you want (what you want)
Well I know what you want, you want the better of two halves

Well I know what you want (what you want)
Well I know what you want (what you want)
Well I know what you want, you want the better of two halves
