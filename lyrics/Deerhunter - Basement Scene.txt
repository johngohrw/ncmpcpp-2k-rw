Dream, a little dream
All about the basement scene
I don't wanna wake up, I don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up, no

If you've seen the light turn gold
Come out tonight and we'll get stoned
I don't wanna get old, I don't wanna get old
I don't wanna get old, no

Dream, a little dream
About your friends and their endings
Now I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up
I wanna wake up now

It could be the death of me
Knowing that my friends will not remember me
I wanna get old, I wanna get old
I wanna get old

In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know
In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know

In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know
In the bluffs they know my name
In the bluffs they know

Oh, shit
