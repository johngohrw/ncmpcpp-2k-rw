Time Enough For Rocking When We're OldThe Magnetic FieldsThere'll be time enough for rocking when we're oldWe can rock all day in rocking chairs of goldBut tonight I think I'd rather just go dancing There'll be time enough for rocking when we're old, my loveThere'll be time enough for talk in the nursing homeDarling, time enough to write an epic poemBut tonight I think I'd rather just go dancingThere'll be time enough for talking in the home, my loveThere'll be time enough for sleeping when we're deadYou will have a velvet pillow for your headBut tonight I think I'd rather just go dancingThere'll be time enough for sleeping when we're dead, my loveThere'll be time enough for sex and drugs in HeavenWhen our pheromones are turned up to 11But tonight I think I'd rather just go dancingThere'll be time enough for sex and drugs in heaven, my loveAnd time enough for rocking when we're old[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Time_Enough_For_Rocking_When_We%27re_Old ]
