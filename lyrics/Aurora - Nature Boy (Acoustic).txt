There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A lucky day he passed my way
Then we spoke of many things:
Fools and kings
Then he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is to love and be loved in return"
