Sinking fast, undertow
Pull me in, don't let go
On your mark, ready set
Feel your breath on my neck

Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips
Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips

Overwhelmed, hazy eyes
Staring at tinted skies
And I like what we do
Running wild just us two

Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips
Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips
Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips
Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips

Sip each second drink it slowly
Watch the hours melt away
Sip each second drink it slowly
Watch the hours melt away

Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips
Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
Your lips, your lips
Your lips, they got me going
Heart flips, you got me floatin’
You got me float in’
Your Flips
