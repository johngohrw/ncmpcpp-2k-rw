I don't like you anymore
And fallen for the phone again
Enticed me for a second time today
Only for me to realise the same

I don't like you anymore
Cracked and your face is changing
You're going down the old route
But I can't let your repeat and repeat it again
The sound of your voice
Is piercing my patience
As you turn through the midnight corridors

Can we keep in your resent
Retire to the setting a hint
Drying in an old familiar cast
Twitching as I fear it's far too late

Cause I don't like you anymore
I don't like you anymore

I don't like you anymore
Cracked and your face is changing
You're going down the old route
But I can't let you repeat and repeat it again
The sound of your voice
Is piercing my patience
As you turn through the midnight corridors

And there's stuff in the corridors
There is no escape from these
No offence to your trap and be your disease
Well you are just a something to cease
And you swear that you think that you tease
But you pout which is about
And your final lie can be described as fine
It can be described as fine
