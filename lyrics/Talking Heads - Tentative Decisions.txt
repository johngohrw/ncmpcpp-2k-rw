Now that I can
Release my tensions
Let me make clear
My best intentions
Girls ask and I
define decision
Boys ask and I
describe their function

Oh the boys
want to talk
Like to to talk about those problems
And the girls
say they're concerned
And they are
concerned with these decisions

And it's all
Hard Logic
To follow and the
Girls get lost
And the boys
say they're concerned
But they are
concerned with these decisions

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you
I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

Decide, decide
Make up your mind
Decide, decide
I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse
Describe what I found
Confuse, confuse
I told you what to say

Oh the girls
Still want to talk
Want to talk about those problems
And the boys
say they're concerned
But they are concerned with these decisions

And it's all
Hard Logic
I know
and the girls get lost
And the boys
say they're concerned
And they are concerned with these decisions

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you
I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

Decide, decide
Make up your mind
Decide, decide
I told you what to say
Confuse, confuse
Describe what I found
Confuse, confuse
I told you what to say
