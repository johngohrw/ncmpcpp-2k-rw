Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know

Oh, two tone man may take a lonely road
Hey, do you really want to?
Hey, do you really want to?
One chance, two times, make it last again
Hey, do you really want to?
Hey, do you really want to?
Hide from your desires?
No way, no way, no
Hide from your desires?
No way, no way, no

Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story
Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story, story

Short start, bottom line
Heart goes racing up
Hey, do you really want to?
Hey, do you really want to?
We can hardly count the days at work
Hey, do you really want to?
Hey, do you really want to?
Hide from your desires?
No way, no way, no
Hide from your desires?
No way, no way, no

Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story
Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story, story

Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story
Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story, story

What do you know?
Who said "I know love"
"But keep your head above those waters"
"Go where the current leads"
"Go with your inner dreams"
And he disappeared with white wings into the unknown

Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know

Out of sight
Out of sight
You keep it out of sight
Out of sight
Out of sight
You keep it out of sight

Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story
Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story, story

Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story
Alive
Awake without a warning
Born into a story, story

Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know
Hey, you would know
