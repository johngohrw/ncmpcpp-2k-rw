Lover, will you look at me now? 
I'm already dead to you 
But I'm inclined to explain to you what I could not before
Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say
I am sorry the words ?
For I deserve more
For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Tell me, do you think of me now?
As I think of you
For I could not have shaken the touch of your breath on my arm
For it has stayed in me, as an epithet
I am sorry the words ?
For I'm on the floor
In the room where we made it our last touch of the night

I walked, 'cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation, to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more

I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

Lover, will you look from me now?
I'm already dead
But I've come to explain why I left such a mess on the floor
For when you went away, I went crazy
I was wild with the ? of a ?
I ran through the night
With a knife in my chest, with the lust of your loveless ?

I walked, 'cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation, to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more

I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

I walked, 'cause you walked
Yes I walked, 'cause you walked
