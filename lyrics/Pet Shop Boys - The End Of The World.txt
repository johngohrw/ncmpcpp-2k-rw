Floods of tears and doors slamming
Stamping feet across the landing
Because of your obligation
To stay home and fight
Sitting down to a composition
Test the limits of your inhibition
If the phone hasn't rung by midnight
It's over tonight

If someone tried, you'd realize
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world

Piles of toast and broken promises
Among the books and pens and reading glasses
It seems there's no escape from the humdrum
It's over and done

If someone tried, you'd realize
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world
If someone cried, you'd sympathize
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world

At midnight in desperation
Imagine total teenage destruction

The Prophets all predicted extinction
The Virgin spoke in apparitions
And if it all came to pass now
You feel we'd all deserve it somehow

But if someone tried (you'd realize)
You'd realize (and sympathize)
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world
If someone cried (you'd sympathize)
You'd sympathize (and realize)
It's just a boy or a girl
It's not the end of the world
It's not the end
