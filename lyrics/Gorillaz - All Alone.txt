All alone...

Leviticus
Deuteronomy

Snatch a piece of my wondering
This did fall like under in
Skid em with two lights
Skid em with boot light
Fly in my soup like
Where's the waitress
Can't take this really can't finish this
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake I'll make it
J'd up to the boom now make it
Bounce wiggle bounce wiggle shaking all them things out
Chemical cutthroats 'bout to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain
This ain't no game
I'll show no shame
I'll birth this bane
I'll twist the game
I'll twist the game
I'll push this plane
It's plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you know where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear
We're happy and we lonesome
The lone drum the beat hot
From start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach
The soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over
We turn up the 'oh God'

All alone...

Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be
Come and save the night
Coz I don't leave
When the morning comes it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me...

All alone...
