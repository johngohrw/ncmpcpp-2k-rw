How's your heart been beating
How's your skin been keeping
How's the dream been going
Since you came back home 
This time you left her out there somewhere
Told her how you feel but
Never really got your chance to show her, what it really means to love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her

Closer to the ending
She's still out pretending
Prying eyes won't recognize the way she feels about him
She'll just go on living
The river keeps on rolling
Knowing all the time she'll never understand just what it means to love her
The way you'd love her
The way you'd love to love her
The way you'd love her
