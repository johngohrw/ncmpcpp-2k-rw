Fuck that
8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half, wait
Nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
When your age don’t exist

[Verse 1]
Man, I swear
My nigga trippin off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope to take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 80
And you feeling like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I’m in the house party trippin off
My generation sippin cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the word is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? we never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
Playstation and some drank
Technology bumping Soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that’s product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel’s dream
Yep, the president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that dap
Is like when she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got ADHD

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Like woah oh oh woah [x4]
(Don’t got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(Don’t got a limit just gimme some more with it)
(They always told me ad-hd did it)

[Verse 2]
And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Ok then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I’mma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It’s nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
You can have all my shine
I’ll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I’ll give you the light
