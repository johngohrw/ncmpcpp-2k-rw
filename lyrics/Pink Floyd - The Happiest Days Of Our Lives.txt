When we grew up and went to school 
There were certain teachers who would 
Hurt the children any way they could 
By pouring their derision 
Upon anything we did 
And exposing every weakness 
However carefully hidden by the kids 
But in the town it was well known 
When they got home at night, their fat and 
Psychopathic wives would thrash them 
Within inches of their lives
