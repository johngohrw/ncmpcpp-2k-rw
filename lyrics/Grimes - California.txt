Chasing something beautiful
Oh, but I don't understand what they say

Commodifying all the pain

The things they see in me, I cannot see myself
When you get bored of me, I'll be back on the shelf
And when the ocean rises up above the ground
Baby I'll drown in...

California
I didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
California
You only like me when you think I'm looking sad
