Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become

But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're thing, I think this thing's begun
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
To prove my love to you?

Special favors come in 31 flavors
We're out of mints, pass the Life Savers
I'm droppin hints, candy for candy-coated tongue

You'd be so good, so very good for me
What do you think? Tell me honestly?
I'm wait-wait-wait-waiting for you to come
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, prove my love to you

Third verse, same as the first
Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become

But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're thing, I think this thing's begun

Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
I'd do anything, what do I have to do
I'd do it all, what do I have to do
I'd do it all for you, what do I have to do
I'd do anything, I'd do it all, I'd do it all for you
I'd climb a mountain, I'd cross the ocean, I'd do it it all
Tell me now, what do I have to do to prove my love to you?
