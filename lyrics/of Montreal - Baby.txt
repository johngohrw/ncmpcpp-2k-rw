I'm so glad I have you to think of,
To channel all my loving energy into.

Even though my feelings aren't returned,
And in time I won't think about you this way,
That still doesn't stop me,
If just for now, wishing we were each other's baby.

I feel these emotions for you still I know
There's no way that you're the person
I imagine you to be

I don't know if it was chance,
or if this happened by fate.
I don't expect you to feel the same,
But if you did, well that would be great.

Minutes can make memories that last a life time.
I distort my minutes of beauty
into something that they're not.

These things don't stop me,
If just for now, wishing we were each other's baby.
