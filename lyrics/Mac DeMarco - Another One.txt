Feelin' so confused
You dont know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore
And though she says she does and hasn't lost your trust
Who could there be knockin at her door
 
Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
[x2]

The feelin' never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishin' for tomorrow today
She still says shes true
So you start comin' to
Just as that old knockin' comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
[x2]
