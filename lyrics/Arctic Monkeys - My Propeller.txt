If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

Coax me out my low
Sink in to tomorrow
Coax me out my low and have a spin of my propeller

My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
My propeller
