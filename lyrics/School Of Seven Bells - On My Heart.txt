It hurts to know
That you don't trust me
When you try to bust me
It only makes me trust you
Less to know that I don't get respect
When I've given you my word
And you go with what you heard
Instead you go and simmer through the night
Then we end up in a fight
And it's such a waste of time
Now I know you're feeding me a line
But you say that you're in love
But you're stewing all the time

I know you got a lot to question
That made a big impression
I know that you've been hurt for a while--why did you apologize
When it was before my time is an answer I will give you
And so when you call me on the phone
And you hear I'm not alone
No it doesn't mean that things have gone wrong
There was a you before me
There was a me before you
And that's the way it goes

You don't need to worry on my heart
It's written one way
You won't give her the ground, just forget her
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe

You don't need to worry on my heart
It's written one way
You won't give her the ground, just forget her
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe

With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe
With me you're love-safe
