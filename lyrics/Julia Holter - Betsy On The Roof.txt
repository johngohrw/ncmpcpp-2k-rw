Betsy on the roof
I can't send the rain down baby
I can't send the rain down anymore

"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!"

"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!"

What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?

Moon and emotion
Elsewhere is my name now
We don't dim the lights down anymore

"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!"

"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!" she said
"Uh oh!"

I can't remember the words to say
I don't remember the words to say to you

I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy
My arms stretched out, looking up
Won't you please tell me the answer?
You know the answer, Betsy

I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy
My arms stretched out, looking up
Won't you please tell me the answer?
You know the answer, Betsy

I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy
My arms stretched out, looking up
Won't you please tell me the answer?
You know the answer, Betsy
