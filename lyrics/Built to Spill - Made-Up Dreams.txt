These thoughts are old
Let's keep it cold
Dry lines on me
Dry history

Dryology

That stupid sound
That awful feel
Don't bring them down
And it never will

No, it never will
No, it never will
No, it never will

Hard to believe
That after all this time
That after all this I'm
Still me

No one wants to hear
What you dreamt about
Unless you dreamt about them

Don't let that stop you
Tell them anyway
And you can make it up
As you go

I'm already gone now
You were outside, just waiting
I'm already nothing
You just noticed me fading

It takes a lot to make me crazy
And a lot is always going on
