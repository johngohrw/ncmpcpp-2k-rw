I wanna tear apart my heart
Glue the pieces to my car
Crash it into a wall
I don't wanna feel at all
I wanna break apart my heart

Douse it in gasoline
'till the fire burns clean
Then flick a cigarette
Like that movie con-air
Doused in gasoline

And if you think you are better than me your right
There's no one to love, no one to trust
In my life

I wanna pick up the pieces
And plant them in the ground
And when a tree grows there
I want to chop that tree down

Build it into a boat
And float it into a lake
And with dynamite 
I will explode the thing 
That makes me make mistakes

Sometimes I get so lonesome I can't breathe
Sometimes I get so scared I can't speak
Sometimes I get so worried I can't hear my heart beat...anyway
Anyway

I wanna tear out my heart
And give it away
Too a person more deserving one day
If all I see is the worst in everything
Thats all I'm gonna get, it's all I'm gonna get
