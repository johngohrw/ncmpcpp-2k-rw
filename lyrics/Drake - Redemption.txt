Yeah, I get it
I get it
Yeah

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
A Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin' with just me and you
Girl, really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since take care, I've been caretakin'
At second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know
