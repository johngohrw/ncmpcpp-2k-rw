I've been..
Oh I've been waiting definitely
And my heart is here right next to me
And I'm caught waiting in the rainx2
and I know and it [?] and I oh-oh-oh-I-I, oh-oh-oh-I-I-I-I
Hey hey you wanna play but baby I can go go 
And every other day you're running over flow but baby I'd implore you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it [x2]
ooh ha huh ha huh ah huh ah huh
Baby I'd implore you, if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it
I hold on and I don't care what you say but the way it goes it's happening everyday I can't see straight [?]
I hold on and I don't care what you say because the way it goes it's happening everyday
Everyday [x5] day d-day d-day
Everydayd-day d-day
Everydayd-day d-day
Hey hey you wanna play but baby I can go go and every other day you're running over flow-flow baby I'd implore you if I didn't know you but I'm paying for it [x2]
