Rejoice, rejoice God’s ears are stitches
Rejoice, His eyes are big X’s (axes)
Rejoice, His arms are burning witches
Rejoice, His hands perform hexes

Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
Rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
Rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you’re trying your best

Rejoice, the bed you sleep in is burning
Rejoice, the sky’s fucking falling
Rejoice, the world we know is turning
Rejoice, your father’s been calling

Rejoice although this world will devastate you
Rejoice although this world will penetrate you
Rejoice although you will not survive
Rejoice you’ll never make it out alive

Rejoice, your hair it smells like burning (hair)
Oh rejoice, your nails all got chewed off
Rejoice, and holy fuck you’re bleeding (there)
Oh rejoice, you burned your whole beard off

Rejoice despite the fact this world will hurt you
Rejoice despite the fact this world will kill you
Rejoice despite the fact this world will tear you to shreds
Rejoice because you’re trying your best
