Only bored as I get older
Find the ways to cult, cult of time
Only bored as I get older
Find new ways to spend my time

I'm a gold digging man
Find my money, find my land
I'm a gold, gold digging man
I won't rest 'til I buy your land

Sweetness comes suffering
In sweetness comes suffering
I won't rest till I can't breathe
I can't breathe with you looking at me

I get bored as I get older
Can you help me figure this out?

Come on, dream on

"I lived on a table
I don't know where to go
I know my friends would
I know where my friends are now

I lived on a farm, yeah
I never lived on a farm
Where did my friends go?
Where did my friends go?"

What do you do when you're sleeping?
Where did you go when you said:
"I don't need nobody on my bond"
"I don't need nobody on my bond"

Where do your friends go?
Where do they see you?
What did you want to be?
Ah, shut the hell, shut your mouth
