Turning over in my bed
Lose myself to dreams instead
Ghostly figures on the wall
Dreams of you have grown so tall

Gone inside your talk
Inside a smile, I'm unraveling
Caught within your stare
Within your touch, such a subtle sting

Love the way you make me feel, I want it all the time
Hate the way you make me feel, you're all that's on my mind
Losing track and losing time, and I forget to breath
Should've seen the water rising, now I'm in too deep

Standing in my room alone
Yet I'm feeling far from home
Tired as my knuckles white
I've been holding on too tight

Stay, you're in my head
You're in my words, even when you're gone
Stick, I've caught your eye
I've caught your chill, and I still hold on

Love the way you make me feel, I want it all the time
Hate the way you make me feel, you're all that's on my mind
Losing track and losing time, and I forget to breath
Should've seen the water rising, now I'm in too deep
