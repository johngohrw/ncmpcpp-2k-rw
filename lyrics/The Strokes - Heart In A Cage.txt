Well I don't feel better
When I'm fucking around
And I don't write better
When I'm stuck in the ground

So don't teach me a lesson
'Cause I've already learned
Yeah, the sun will be shining
And my children will burn

Oh the heart beats in its cage

I don't want what you want
I don't feel what you feel
See I'm stuck in a city
But I belong in a field

Yeah, we got left, left, left, left, left, left, left
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone

Oh the heart beats in its cage

All our friends they're laughing at us
All of those you loved, you mistrust
Help me, I'm just not quite myself
Look around there's no one else left

I went to the concert
And I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited
When I thought you were around

Oh, he gets left, left, left, left, left, left, left
And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire

Oh, the heart beats in its cage
Yes the heart beats in its cage
(Alright)

And the heart beats in its cage
