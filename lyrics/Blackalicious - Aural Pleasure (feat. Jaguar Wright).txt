In amidst, of the deep blue abyss, without your love found chance
Energy surround, enhance spirit now Aural Pleasure
In amidst your souls across ropes checking where your mind sun shines
Energy surround your head spinning now aural pleasure

They call me Gab and I rap
And I do my thing and swing it bring it
In my hab-i-tat
Where my vocals stinging even linger
In the back of your neck
Where you feel the tingle lingle ling
You will adapt to your snapping your thumb and finger eagerly
Now since we have to achieve
We must believe believe believe
Into a certain degree
Just like the wheat you need to feed you
Man this circus won't cease
It just eats and eats and eats
Until we serving these beats
In addition to serving MCs
'Till they go berserk and then freeze
Any day of the week I speak through speakers
You can burn with this heat
MCs you freeze to see (the reasons)?
Take your circuits and free ya up
From the he's and she's and needs
Emotion surface to be
Having your search through the abyss Aural Pleasure y'all

In amidst, of the deep blue abyss, without your love found chance
Energy surround, enhance spirit now Aural Pleasure
In amidst your souls across ropes checking where your mind sun shines
Energy surround your head spinning now aural pleasure

Check it out

On the corner of jail, but not a dealer of death
Realer, iller, conceal a feeling, sealing there's nothing left
On the top, on its penicillin, you got wish
It's a oracle, then it seize ya, I'm sure you got lifted
Oceans of rhythm inside a killer go ta death
Coming divine as I reach and travel in the depths
Moving your spirit just like you're walking through a 'X'
Choice of the generation, that come and be the peps
Bubbling all in your cups, don't even follow it up
Nothing to wallow in but the sound that you're gobbling up
Rocking in time until your popping your mommy up
Calling your Aunt, and also your pa, and the swallow the funk
It's just a little something that open your comatose
Stay to living in Babylon, with the spiritually dead ghost
This is recommended, I highly advise a toast
Hopefully it inspires and maybe encourages growth
Aural Pleasure y'all [x5]

In amidst, of the deep blue abyss, without your love found chance
Energy surround, enhance spirit now Aural Pleasure
In amidst your souls across ropes checking where your mind sun shines
Energy surround your head spinning now aural pleasure

Watch out Blazing Arrow

Test 'til it's scarred
Press through the storm
Find who we are, with true desire
For no human being
Quest for your dreams
By any means, endure the fire

PURE
Test and trial
An error destined to endure
Infallible unyielding to the adversary's law
'Cause I graft for the after me
Syntax in a masterpiece burner
Unless your flame's life surpasses eternal
You couldn't swing it if you had a pendulum strapped to your sternum
I am the sun
One with the son of man righteousness
Won't be defeated by the underhand faceless
Hands in the presence of greatness
I'll teach you how to backstroke
With cinder block bracelets
Dark paddling kicking in the quick sand no aces
Constance under pressure
Test how true your faith is FAITH

You wanna see my face, connect the stars
Passion birth right RAW	
Hide electric Gibson guitars
Spark cohibra cigars
African Tsars
From the call
Think fast like Ramadan
I'm beyond the book of Ramah ad
Nigeria Phenomenon
A bbo
Dot to dot
I am the might of common law
Kum Bay ya
Chronicle
Got the run of flow
Jungles beside a hole
Songs that a side atold Geronimo platoon
Undergrounds a phat
I tousle now swallow slow
Let my fire killer higher
Hell a soul
Floss you with barbwire coils
Anoints with Allah bills
Cause royal karma's close
And can't wait (And can't wait)
God's be ghost
Waving a burning spear
I am Faith I am Faith I am Faith
