[Dr. Dre]
Back with some shit that gots to bump
As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk
Just to floss you like a motherfuker, clownin' their shit
Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe
If she proper, I'ma pop her the hole hopper
It's back on the track
With big money, big nuts, and a big fat chronic sack 

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
So Daz, step up on the ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past 

[Dat Nigga Daz]
Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK
That I bring as I slang like cavy
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back
Here I come, stompin' in my kakhi suit
BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling 

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
But did you raise up all this nuts?
Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up

[Snoop] You tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E 

[Dr. Dre]
Now check me out, it's back to the old school
Where the niggaz get their strap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky ass shit by the D-O-double G-Y D-O-double G
Real G'z who drop K's, protect these N-U-T, so nigga please
Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit
(Beeyatch!!) So recognize game from the gangsta
Thangs will remain the same until I change 'em 

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
It's real easy to see
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double G 

[Nate Dogg]
