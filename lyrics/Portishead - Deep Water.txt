I'm drifting in deep water
Alone with my self-doubting, again
Try not to struggle this time
For I will weather the storm

Gotta remember (gonna remember)
Don't fight it (don't fight it)
Even if I (even if I)
Don't like it (don't like it)

Somehow, turn me around
(Somehow, turn me around)

No matter how far I drift
Deep waters (Deep waters)
Won't scare me tonight
