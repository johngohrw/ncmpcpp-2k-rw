Black shadows dance beyond the neon glow
There's rumours in your head that just won't let go
They hold on so tight, it makes your blood run cold
Nailed in the night trying to save your soul

Don't be afraid
It's just a cry from the street

It's fine to believe that what they keep they own
So you've lost someone that you thought you owned
You know it's a crime, but what can you do?
That's the price you pay with each turn of the screw

But don't pay no mind
It's just a cry from the street

You really love the night, living on your love
It's such a crying shame that things are so rough
As the sirens scream, through your blinds you peep
I guess the chances are you wish you'd stayed asleep

But don't be afraid
It's just a cry from the street
