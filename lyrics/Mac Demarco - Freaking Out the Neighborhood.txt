Sorry, mama, there are times I get carried away
Please, don't worry, next time I'm home, I'll still be the same

And I know it's no fun when your first son
Gets up to no good, starts freaking out the neighborhood

Really, I'm fine, never been better, got no job on the line
Sincerely, don't worry, same old boy that you hoped you would find 

And I know it's no fun when your first son
Gets up to no good, starts freaking out the neighborhood
