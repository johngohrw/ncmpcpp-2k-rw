Run, run, run, run [repeat line four times]
You better make your face up in 
Your favourite disguise 
With your button down lips and your 
Roller blind eyes 
With your empty smile 
And your hungry heart 
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past 
With your nerves in tatters 
As the cockleshell shatters 
And the hammers batter 
Down your door 
You better run 

Run, run, run, run [repeat line four times]
You better run all day 
And run all night 
And keep your dirty feelings 
Deep inside. And if your 
Takin' your girlfriend 
Out tonight 
You better park the car 
Well out of sight 
'Cos if they catch you in the back seat 
Trying to pick her locks 
They're gonna send you back to mother 
In a cardboard box 
You better run
