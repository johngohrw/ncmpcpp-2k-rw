Hey lady--you got the love I need 
Maybe more than enough. 
Oh Darling... walk a while with me 
You've got so much... 

Many have I loved - Many times been bitten 
Many times I've gazed along the open road. 

Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened 
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know. 

Many dreams come true and some have silver linings 
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold. 

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing 
Many many men can't see the open road. 

Many is a word that only leaves you guessing 
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, ooh! 
You really ought to know...
