Armour let it through, borne the arboretic truth you kept posing
Sat down in the suit, fixed on up it wasn't you by finished closing

Ramble in the roots, had the marvel, moved the proof be kneeled fine's glowing
Storing up the clues, it had it's sullen blue bruised through by showing

Settle past a patience where wishes and your will are spilling pictures
Water's running through in the valley where we grew to write this scripture:

Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Not for a part in any gamut of the dark

Doubled in the toes annex it, it minute closed in the morning
Did not lose it in the stack's stow, I'm a lay that call back on ya

You know it won't beseech you, we're laying in an open field
I will let you grow, no need to notice

So carry on my dear, what is clear up in the daylight is we're hung here
Fall is coming soon, a new year for the moon and the Hmong here

Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
All that it seems
Bellows tracing through the streams

Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
Never gonna break
All at it's seams
Swallows swelling for the beams
