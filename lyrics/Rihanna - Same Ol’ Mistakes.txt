I can just hear them now,
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I've found,
Or see it from this way round.
Feeling it overtake,
All that I used to hate,
One by one every trait,
I tried but it's way too late.
All the signs I don't read,
Two sides of me can't agree,
Will I be in too deep?
Goin' with what I always longed for.

Feel like a brand new person, (But you'll make the same old mistakes)
Well I don't care I'm in love, (Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person, (But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like, (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late, I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening.
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

Finally taking flight,
I know you don't think it's right,
I know that you think it's fake,
Maybe fakes what I like,
The point is I have the right,
Not thinking in black and white,
Thinking it's worth the fight,
Soon I'll be out of sight,
Knowing it all this time,
Going with what I always longed for.

Feel like a brand new person, (But you'll make the same old mistakes)
Well I don't care I'm in love, (Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person, (But you'll make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know if it's right? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)

Man I know that it's hard to digest,
But maybe your story,
Ain't so different from the rest.
And I know it seems wrong to accept,
But you've got your demons,
And she's got her regrets.
Man I know that it's hard to digest,
A realisation, is as good as a guess.
And I know it seems wrong to accept,
But you've got your demons,
And she's got her regrets.
But you've got your demons,
And she's got her regrets.

Feel like a brand new person,
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction,
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking of the only option)
Feel like a brand new person,
I finally know what it's like. (Stop thinking of the only option)
In a new direction

So how will I know if its right?
(Stop thinking of the only option)
