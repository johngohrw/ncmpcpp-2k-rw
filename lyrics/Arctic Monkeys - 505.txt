[Chorus:]
I'm going back to 505,
If it's a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs,

Stop and wait a sec,
Oh when you look at me like that my darling,
What did you expect,
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck,
Or I did last time I checked,

Not shy of a spark,
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark,
Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark,
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start,

[Chorus]

But I crumble completely when you cry,
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye,
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise,
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon,

[Chorus]

...and a smile
