Well everytime that I come home nobody wants to let me be 
It seems that all the friends I got just got to come interrogate me 
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by 
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well its true I love the money and I love my brand new car 
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playing in a honky tonk bar 
But when I come off the road, well I just got to have my time 
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose my mind

[Chorus]
So, don't ask me no questions 
And I won't tell you no lies 
So, don't ask me about my business 
And I won't tell you goodbye

That's right

Well, "what's your favorite color and do you dig the brothers," is drivin' me up a wall 
And everytime I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call 
Well don't you think that when I come home, I just want a little peace of mind 
If you want to talk about the business buddy, you're just wastin' time

[Chorus]

I said don't ask no stupid questions and I won't send you away 
If you want to talk fishin, well I guess that'll be OK
