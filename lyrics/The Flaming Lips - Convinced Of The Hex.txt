She submits as she dominates
She gets out of her head
As she talks to the ceiling
You can hear what she said
She said, "That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
You see, that's the difference between us"

She says, "I like your theory
But it won't pass no test
Watching the watchers
Getting shot in the chest
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us"

She says, "You think there's some system
That controls and affects
You see, I believe in nothing
And you're convinced of the hex
I believe in nothing
And you're convinced of the hex

That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
That's the difference between us
You see, that's the difference between us"
