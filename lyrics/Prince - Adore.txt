Until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
U own my heart and mind
I truly adore U
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see
Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what U mean 2 me

From the first moment I saw U
Ooh, I knew U where the 1
That night I had 2 call U
I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' U just how fine U look
In a word, U were sex
All of my cool attitude U took
My body was next
U made love 2 me
Like U where afraid
Was U afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
That's why

Until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
U own my heart and mind
I truly adore U
If God one day struck me blind
Your beauty I'd still see
Love is 2 weak 2 define
Just what U mean 2 me

When we be makin' love
I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above
Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know U are my fix
I know, that U know that I ain't cheatin' baby
They know this is serious
I ain't fuckin' just 4 kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial baby
U could say that I'm a terminal case
U could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got 2 have your face
All up in the place

I'd like 2 think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' baby could compare
2 your lovely face
Do U know what I'm sayin' 2 ya this evening
I'm just tryin' 2 say
I'm just tryin' 2 say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there 4 U
I'll be there 4 U
On my heart, on my mind, (truly adore U)
I truly adore U (darlin')
U don't know what you're mean 2 me
Baby, (until the end of time)
Baby, (I'll be there 4 U)
Baby, (U own my heart and mind)
'Til the end of time I'll be there 4 U
(I truly adore U)
Adore U (adore U)

Can I talk 2 U? {{chorus repeated in background}}
Tell U what U mean 2 me
Every time U wander
I'll be your eyes so U can see
I wanna show U things
That I show no other, I wanna be
More than, more than your mother
More than your brother
I wanna be (like no) like no other
If U need me, I'll never leave
I know, that U know, without U there is no me
There is no me
Without U there is no sea
There is no shore
Love is 2 weak 2 define how much I adore
U, child
U, child
The last words U hear
The last words U hear

(until the end of time)
I'll be there for you, baby
(until the end of time)

Be with me darlin' til the end of time (until the end of time)
I'll give U my heart
I'll give U my mind
I'll give U my body (until the end of time)
I'll give U my time (until the end of time)
(until the end of time)

4 all time I am with U
U are with me
(until the end of time)
U are with me, U are with me
