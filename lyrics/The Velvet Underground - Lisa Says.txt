Lisa says that it's allright
When she meets me alone at night
Lisa says that she has a fun
And she'll do it with just about anyone.

Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says
Lisa says that she's on the run
Looking for a special one
Lisa says that every time she makes his trip
She knows her heart will beat

Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says
Looking for a part and some action
Going to make it feel okay
But what do you find
When the time has come on, now
Look at it run

Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says
Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says...
