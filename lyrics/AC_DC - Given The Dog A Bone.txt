She take you down easy
Going down to her knees
Going down to the devil
Down down at ninety degrees
She blowing me crazy
'til my ammunition is dry
She's using her head again
She's using her head
She's using her head again
I'm justa giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone

She's no Mona Lisa
No she's no playboy star
But she'll send you to heaven
Then explode you to Mars
She's using her head again
She's using her head
She's using her head again
I'm justa giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone

She's got the power of union
She only hits when it's hot
And if she likes what you're doing
She'll give you the lot give it everything I got
Just giving the dog a bone

Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone

I'm justa giving the dog a bone
Giving the dog a bone, giving the dog a bone
I'm justa giving the dog a bone
