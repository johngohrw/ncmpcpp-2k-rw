Another time another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night

One way ticket no returns
My shooting star so fast it burnt
On the edge that you can see

Let's shoot the moon you and me
I'm not particular you'll see
Just a lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shooting plasma from my grave

Event horizon lost in space
Running in a human race

I don't know where I don't know why
But somehow back in time again
I'm on the edge that you can see

I'm not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won't be tracking me by sight

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light

We slip into the night
