It'll take you to the top 
And out to the edge 
Shoot up needles through your blood 
Lay ice under your sledge 

Shift, crank, pull 
Shift, crank, pull 
Adrenaline, adrenaline 

Shift, crank, adrenaline 

It'll put you through your paces 
Kickstart your heart 
Push you to the limit 
Make the finish just the start 

Shift, crank, pull 
Shift, crank, pull 
Shift, crank, pull 
Adrenaline 

A-a-a-drenaline, adrenaline 
A-a-a-drenaline, adrenaline 

It'll save the life of a junkie 
Closing on death 
Counteract the poison 
Give him back his breath 

Shift, shift, crank, pull 
Shift, crank, pull 
Shift, crank, pull 
Adrenaline 

A-a-a-drenaline, woah-ohhhh 
A-a-a-drenaline, a-a-a-adrenaline 

Pushing flesh and marrow 
Kicking bone and blood 
Boosting up the cell count 
As the burning [?] is flood 

Adrenaline, adrenaline 
Shift, crank, pull 
Shift, crank, pull 

A-a-a-drenaline, shift, crank 
A-a-a-drenaline, pull 
A-a-a-drenaline, adrenaline
