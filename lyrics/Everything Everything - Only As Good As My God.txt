I turn the firehouse on
Then I got away through all ya
Make it slam against the (ooh) wall, (ooh) wall
And through the windows of the bank and the pharmacy yeah

I, I, I, I cordoned off the whole street
Then my horses on the concrete
Make you quiver and I (ooh) shake, (ooh) quake
You can't get out of my way so you're split to pieces

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as a good as my God
Burnt hair and more money
[x2]

I, I, I cut off the head of that snake
Then you watch them scatter and break
It's as simple as aâ€” (ooh) tick, (ooh) tock
Defenestrate them all night, let me grab a latte

(Ooh) and on the steps of my church
There I'm chasing down a red girl
With my hooves upon a (ooh) wild (ooh) child
I bet you didn't think of this when you woke up this morning

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as a good as my God
Burnt hair and more money
[x2]

If they crawl out of the mud
Wash them away in a flood
I'm only as a good as my God
Burnt hair and more money
[x2]
