[El-P:]
Oh dear what the fuck have we here?
These motherfuckers all thorn no rose
Egads what a bad dream better not sleep
Take a No-Doz, do some blow
Oh shit what the hell have we done?
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough
It is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair but the pair
We got beat that weak shit you got (true god)
Blew up the spot with that new bop
Crew drops, do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the
Sounds I make are the sounds of the hounds
That are howlin - Under your bed I'm here growling
Same time under the blanket you're cowering

[Killer Mike:]
Cowering like cowards cowering on
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smile at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say run the jewels
Just run' em baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam god damn we fuckin crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby
She clutched the pearls, said "What in the world!"
And "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle
And I shot that bitch

[Hook:]
Run the jewels...[x2]

[El-P:]
And the crowd chants "Get that paper!"
And the mob says "Kill that witch!"
This city get mad to the max
Better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids
Get a tin foil hat for the rain, in
Hot water from the roof to the basement
I'mma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it

[Killer Mike:]
Often I'm smoking coffin
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like
Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town
Ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me
Cause if they don't somebody get shot
And they gon' buy a coffin

[El-P:]
With the pull of a pin a grenade
Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse
Or a nun in a cum shot (stop it)

[Killer Mike:]
Big beast in a cage with a heart
Full of rage, it seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves
That starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am
And I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Hook]
