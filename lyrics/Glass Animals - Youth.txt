Boy
When I left you you were young
I was gone but not my love
You were clearly meant for more
Than a life lost in the war

All I want's you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit happy

Fly high
Feel your mother at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly high
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

Boy
Now your life is back to fun
But you see that's not for long
Cause I know you'll feel the ghost
Of the memory so warm

Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit happy

Fly high
Feel your mother at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly high
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right

Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit happy

Fly high
Feel your mother at your side
Don't you know you got my eyes
I'll make you fly high
You'll be happy all the time
I know you can make it right
I'll make you...

Boy I want you to be happy
Free to run
Get dizzy on caffeine
Funny friends that make you laugh
And maybe you're just a little bit...
