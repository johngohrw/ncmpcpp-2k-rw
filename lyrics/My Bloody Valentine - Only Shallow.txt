Sleep like a pillow, no one there
Where she won't care anywhere
Soft as a pillow, touch her there
Where she won't dare somewhere

Sweet and mellow softer there
Feel like you grew stronger
Speak your trouble, she's not square
Soft like her silk everywhere

Sleep as a pillow, comfort there
Where she won't dare anywhere
Look in a mirror, she's not there
Where she won't care somewhere
