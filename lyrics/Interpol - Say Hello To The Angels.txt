I want your silent parts
The parts the birds love
I know there's such a place

I had my back turned
You didn't realize
I'm lonely

You lack the things
To which I relate
But I see no harm

Come wait, come wait, come wait
It's over.
One...two...three...do me

When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because,
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into my airspace
You move into my airspace

And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into my airspace
You move into my airspace

But each night, I bury my love around you...
You're linked to my innocence

This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention

This isn't you yet
What you thought was such a conquest
You're hair is so pretty and red
Baby, baby you're really the best...

Can I get there this way?
I think so

We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town
I see my face has changed.

Say hello, say hello, to the angels.
