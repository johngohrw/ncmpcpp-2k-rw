(Tracy Jacks) works in civil service
(Tracy Jacks) it's steady employment
(Tracy Jacks) it's a golfing fanatic
(Tracy Jacks) but his put is erratic
(Tracy Jacks) saw a Harley Street doctor
(Tracy Jacks) who prescribed healthy living
(Tracy Jacks) but he's getting past forty
(Tracy Jacks) and all the seams are splitting

EVERYDAY HE GOT CLOSER
HE KNEW IN HIS HEART HE WAS OVER
I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE AND BE NORMAL
BUT IT'S JUST SO OVERRATED

(Tracy Jacks) left home without warning
(Tracy Jacks) at five in the morning
(Tracy Jacks) got on the first train to Walton
(Tracy Jacks) and stood on the seafront
(Tracy Jacks) threw his clothes in the water
(Tracy Jacks) and ran around naked
(Tracy Jacks) got stopped by the police
(Tracy Jacks) and escorted back home

EVERYDAY HE GOT CLOSER
HE KNEW IN HIS HEART HE WAS OVER
I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE AND BE NORMAL
BUT THEN IT'S JUST SO OVERRATED

Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks

And then it happened on a Tuesday morning
Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in
Saying it's just so overrated
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks

EVERYDAY HE GOT CLOSER
HE KNEW IN HIS HEART HE WAS OVER
I'D LOVE TO STAY HERE AND BE NORMAL
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS OVERRATED
