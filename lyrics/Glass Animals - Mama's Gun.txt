In the summer
Took my gun
And made him go to Neverland
He was something
My old husband
He was all you'd ever want

Did you say somethin'
What'd you say?
Was that your voice or was that me?

Little voices buzzin poison
Backward noise drom everything
Dr Swango
Says I'm psycho
Says they all from Neverland

They'll never ever let me be
Was that your voice or was that me?

Dirty Dustin
Said he saw him
Playin' ball with Dizzy Jim
Dizzy Jim
Had never spoken
Whispered back "You murdered him."

My heart strings broke and it was me
I pull they stretch infinitely

In the summer silence
I was getting violent
In the summer silence
I was doing nothing

Play with me my love
In the summer sun
I'll be waiting it
Your favorite Cheshire grin

Lay with me my dear
In the evening clear
I'll be dreaming in
My paper pale skin

In the summer silence
I was getting violent
In the summer silence
I was doing nothing
