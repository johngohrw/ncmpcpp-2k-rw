Everywhere you want I always go
I always give in because, babe, you know
You just say so cause you give me that
Feeling inside that I know must be right
It's the singer not the song
It's not the way you give in willingly
Others do it without thrilling me
Giving me that same old feeling inside that I
Know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
The same old places and the same old songs
We've been going there for much too long
There's something wrong and it gives me that feeling
Inside that I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song
It's the singer not the song
It's the singer not the song
