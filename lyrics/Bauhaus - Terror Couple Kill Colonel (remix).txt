Terror couple kill colonel 
Terror couple kill colonel 

His eyes were heavy 
He carried a card 
One couple questioned 
The other discharged 
Terror couple kill colonel 
in his West German home 
Three shots from three feet 
Dragged himself to the phone 

Terror couple kill colonel 
Terror couple kill colonel 

And as he lay there 
Playing games with his pain 
He felt his choice of jobs 
Was such a mistake 
He could have been a doctor 
In a soft easy chair 
In stead he chose three stars 
A territorial affair 

Terror couple kill colonel 
Terror couple kill colonel 

In his West German home 
In his West German home 
In his West German home
