You got to get it together
You're shooting at me
You're just a teenage industry
Why are the C.I.A. having fun
They think you're clever 'cos you've blown up your lungs

But I love to hear that crazy beat (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet (yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I love to hear the paradise
I love my brothers on a Saturday night yeah

Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yea [repeat]
Break up

I'm on my mobile and I'm talking to the president
I got to get him for the money I've spent
Trying to get him to party with me
And even offered him ecstasy

But I love to hear that crazy beat (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet (yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I love to hear the paradise
I love my sister and I love her tonight

Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yea 
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah 
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah 
Crazy beat crazy beat yeah yeah 
Break up...It's a beat

But I love to hear that crazy beat (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet (yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I love to hear the paradise
I love my brothers on a Saturday night

but I love to hear that crazy beat, (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Gets the people dancing on their feet (yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
And I love to hear the paradise
I love that feeling and I love her tonight
