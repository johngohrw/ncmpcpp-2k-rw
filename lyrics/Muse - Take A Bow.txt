And bring corruption to all that you touch
Hold

And beholden for all that you've done

Cast a spell
Cast a spell on the country you run
And risk
You will risk
You will risk all their lives and their souls

And burn
You will burn
You will burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell
You'll burn in hell
Yeah you'll burn in hell
For your sins

And our freedom's consuming itself
What we've become
It's contrary to what we want
Take a bow

You bring death and destruction to all that you touch
Pay
You must pay
You must pay for your crimes against the earth

Feed the hex on the country you love
And beg

You will beg for their lives and their souls

And burn
You will burn
You will burn in hell, yeah you'll burn in hell
You'll burn in hell
Yeah you'll burn in hell
You'll burn in hell
Yeah you'll burn in hell
For your sins
