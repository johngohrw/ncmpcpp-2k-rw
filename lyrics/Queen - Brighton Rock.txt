Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

"Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what
do you say"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

O Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays..."
