Under the water we can't breathe, we can't breathe
Under the water we die
Under the water we can't be together
Under the water we are alone

Then why do we jump in?
Why do we jump in?
Under the water we die

So many souls, that lost control
Where did they fall?
And to the deep, what do they see?
Where did they fall?
Where did they fall?

Hearts will dream again
But we'll breathe in
Wash away the sin...
It's where it begins
Feet won't fail you now
Hearts won't let you down
Wash away the sin

Under the water we can't be together
Under the water we die
Then why do we jump in?
Why do we jump in?
Under the water we die

So many souls that lost control
Where did they fall?
And to the deep, what do they see?
Where did they fall?
Where did they fall?

Hearts will dream again
But we'll breathe in
Wash away the sin...
It's where it begins
Feet won't fail you now
Hearts won't let you down
Wash away the sin

It's where it begins...

Hearts will dream again
Wash away the sin....
