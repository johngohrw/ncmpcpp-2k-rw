You know it hurts me when you lie
Sometimes it even makes me cry
'Cause I'm so in love with you
If you don't believe what I have said
Take a look, my eyes are red
'Cause I'm so in love with you
But all those sleepless nights in bed
When you've been out somewhere instead
I wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof
It hurts too much to face the truth
To face the truth

A lawyer with a case to prove
Would sift the evidence, then move
It's the only thing to do
So why then can't I face the facts?
Sift this evidence that backs
I am so in love with you
But all the nights when you have said
You must be somewhere else instead
I wonder where you go, but daren't expose the proof
It hurts too much to face the truth
To face the truth
To face the truth

You are the only one, the only one

You know it hurts me when you lie
Sometimes it even makes me cry
'Cause I'm so in love with you
If you don't believe what I have said
Take a look, my eyes are red
'Cause I'm so in love with you
But all the nights you don't show up
I know it's time I should grow up
I ask you if you care, you stand and stare aloof
It hurts too much to face the truth
To face the truth
To face the truth
