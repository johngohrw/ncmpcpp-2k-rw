To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and spread the blanket
She's too free and I'm the patient

Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain - I know

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did - did what you said
What's the point yo what's the spread

Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain - I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where - I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there
But I don't care
'Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin

Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Let's Sleep weeping willow

Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain - I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
'Cause this is where - I go

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood

It's way out there
But I don't care
'Cause this is what
I want to wear

Knock on wood we all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
