Whiskey gin and brandy
With a glass I'm pretty handy
I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
On sour mash and cheap wine
So join me for a drink boys
We gonna make a big noise
So don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the cheque we'll get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Have a drink on me

I'm dizzy drunk and fightin
On tequila white lightnin
My glass is getting shorter
On whiskey ice and water
So c'mon have a good time
And get blinded outta your mind
So don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Take it today
Forget about the cheque we'll get hell to pay
Have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Yeah have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Get stoned

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
C'mon

Gonna roll around
Gonna hit the ground
Take another swing
Have another drink
Gonna drink you dry
Gonna get me high
C'mon all the boys
Make a noise have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me

Have a drink on me
Have a drink on me
Have a drink
On
Me
