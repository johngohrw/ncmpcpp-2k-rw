Annie, don't run away
Where I can't find you
The game has gone too far
Talking, I'm out of talk
Playing telephone, 20 city blocks
Annie, they have a dossier
The investigation's already underway
Now I try to see, she said to give you a ring
Now I try to sleep, but all I can hear is the beep

Answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine
Just your answering, answering machine
(Why won't you come and find me?)
Answering, answering machine
(Annie, why won't you come and find me?)

And your thunder, a business to trip
There was no other
That is shadowing the place
With that brush you left
I comb the alleyways
I don't miss a beat
The type that stays in place
Annie, I was closing it
But it's clear the number
I'm walking in the rain
To go down the hall
To sit until you call
And I try to sleep, but all I can hear is the beep

(From your)
Answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine
Just your answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine
(Why won't you come and find me?)
Answering, answering machine
(Annie, why won't you come and find me?)
Just your answering, answering machine
Answering, answering machine
(Why won't you come and find me?)
Answering, answering machine
(Annie, why won't you come and find me?)
