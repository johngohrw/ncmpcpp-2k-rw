[Kanye West:]
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Agent Sasco:]
That's all them can do (say wah, say wah)
That's all them can do
We deal with action thing
Just a badman thing a dat dem cab do
Action thing yo a badman thing

Man a badman you fi know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's hard, couldn't try that no day
When we roll round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like a aerosol can)
When we roll round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like an aerosol can)
We ago smile pan court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J

[Kanye West & Justin Vernon:]
That's right I'm in it (Should've known I would fall)
I'm in it (Stepping on tacks on the floor)
That's right (And boys at your door)
That's right I'm in it (Well you need to fight for your own)
That's right I'm in it (Then don't let me at your table)
I'm in it (If you just gonna lay there)
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars
I'll be gone long, grab that  [?] set your  [?]

[Kanye West:]
Picked up where we left off
I need you home when I get off
You know I need that wet mouth
I know you need that reptile
She cut from a different textile
She love different kinds of sex now
Black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)
Lay it off, it off, it off.
Star fucker,
Star fucker,
Star fucker,
Who? Where?

[Kanye West:]
Time to take it too far now
Michael Douglas out the car now
The kids and the wife life
But can't wake up from the night life
I'm so scared of my demons
I go to sleep with a nightlight
My mind move like a Tron bike
Pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
I'm gonna start a new movement
Being led by the drums
I'm a rap-lic priest
Getting head by the nuns
They don't play what I'm playing
They don't see what I'm saying
They be balling in the D-League
I be speaking Swaghili
