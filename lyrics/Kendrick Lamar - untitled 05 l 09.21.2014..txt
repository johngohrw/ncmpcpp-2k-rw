[Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I’m drunk
How can I can make them popular, pop em’ when I want
See I’m livin’ with anxiety, duckin’ the sobriety
Fuckin’ up the system I ain’t fuckin’ with society
Justice ain’t free, therefore justice ain’t me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I’m thinkin’ to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now I’m drinkin’ by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin’ door and blowin’ out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I’m gone

[Anna Wise:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

[Punch & Kendrick Lamar:]
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin’ the handle
Lit off henny, I’m tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I’ve engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That’s a bit ambitious maybe I’m trippin’
Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
It’s such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don’t recognize my flaws
I guess I’m lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I’m tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

[Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock:]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I’m blind
I know that I’m intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can’t compromise
A tape worm couldn’t cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify
But couldn’t fathom the meaning of seein’ sacrifice
I’m passin’ lives on a daily, maybe I’m losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I’m awake
I’m sleep walkin’, I’m street stalkin’, I’m outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait
