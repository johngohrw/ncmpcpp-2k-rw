The vacuum created 
by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling 
witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled
it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it

More idols than realities
I'm OK, you're so-so

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo
