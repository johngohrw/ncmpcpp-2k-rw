Come Back From San FranciscoThe Magnetic FieldsCome back from San FranciscoIt can't be all that pretty When all of New York City misses youShould pretty boys in discosDistract you from your novelRemember I'm awful in love with youYou need me Like the wind needs the trees To blow inLike the moon needs poetryYou need meCome back from San FranciscoAnd kiss me, I've quit smokingI miss doing the wild thing with youWill you stay, I don't think soBut all I do is worryPack bags, call cabs, and hurry home to meYou need me Like the wind needs the trees To blow inLike the moon needs poetryYou need meYou need me Like the wind needs the trees To blow inLike the moon needs poetryYou need meWhen you betray me, betray me with a kissDamn you, I've never stayed up as late as this[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Come_Back_From_San_Francisco ]
