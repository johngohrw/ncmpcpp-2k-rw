[Intro: Dr. Dre (Lady Of Rage)]

Yo yo whut sup?
Yo man, give me some of that ol' gangsta shit, y'knowhutI'msayin?
Some shit I can just kick back to, smoke a fat ass joint to
YouknowhutI'msayin? He hahahahahahaha
Hell yeah! You know what I'm talkin about?
I like that ol' gangsta shit
Cuz you know it's a lot of niggas out there
woofin all that bullshit talkin 'bout they got this and got that
Talkin louder than a motherfucker but ain't sayin shit
Heh y'knowhutI'msayin?
(Dem come witta, dem come witta, dem come wit da wickedness)
Yeah nigga I see your lips quiverin 
But you ain't sayin a motherfuckin thing
For my niggas, I got my niggas in the motherfuckin he-ouse
and they gon' tell yo' what's really goin on
Got my motherfuckin nigga RBX...definitely in this motherfucker
I got my nigga Daz in this motherfucker ready to kick some real shit
Y'knowhutI'msayin?
And that lil' shit cha hear in the background, that's my homegirl Rage
So RBX kick this shit 

[RBX]
Seven execution style murders
I have no remorse cuz I'm the fuckin murderer
Haven't you ever heard of a killer?
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
So now I walk around strapped
One-time bust they caps and watch niggas collapse
Snap! Adapt to this but you need no adapter
This is just the first chapter
in a book from a crook
You get caught slippin yo' ass gots ta die
Nigga, tell me what the fuck you figure?
Trigger? Happy RBX to cap ya
POP POP and I can't wait to bust a pound
POP POP my hollow points smacks the clown
Cuz what I said split his head
And now they got me runnin from the feds
But I refuse to go alive
It's kill or be killed, that's how real niggas survive
I'm high powered! 

[Outro: Dat Nigga Daz]

Yeah!
It's Daz that mass-murderin motherfucker
So what you feel like you wanna get caught up?
Fool you better recognise
Death Row came to chastise
So if you cross the Row
Remember the first name is Death
No love for the other side
