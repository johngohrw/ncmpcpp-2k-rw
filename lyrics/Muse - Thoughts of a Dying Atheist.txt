Eerie whispers
trapped beneath my pillow
won't let me sleep
your memories

and I know you're in this room
I'm sure I heard you sigh
Floating in between
where our worlds collide

scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see

and I know the moment's near
and there's nothing we can do
look through a faithless eye
are you afraid to die?

'cos it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see

And it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
and it scares the hell out of me
and the end is all I can see
