I shy away in my mind
And hope someday I can share this place with you
You'll be the first one defined
The shadows that make the girl you undo
Cause the man that you are is defined
By the way that you act in the light
Break or seize me
If the flame gets blown out in the shine
I will know that you can not be mine
Live or leave me

[Chorus x2:]
When I trust you we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets and I'll whisper 'til the day's done

Break or seize me
Let the things that I tell you survive
In the way that you handle your size
Live or leave me

[Chorus x4]
