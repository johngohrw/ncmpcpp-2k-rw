Seventeen and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad will never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
SKELETONS come to LIFE in my closet

I found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad will never understand
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME

Seventeen and COMING CLEAN for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time
I found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad will never understand
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME
