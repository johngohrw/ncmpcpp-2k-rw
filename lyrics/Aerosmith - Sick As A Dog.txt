Please, I just got to talk to you 
Please, a getcha your head out of the loo 
Please, and we're a long, long way from home 
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone 

[Chorus]

Sick as a dog, what's your story 
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue 
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry 
Sick as a dog, you're really ain't that young 

Please, you were much to my surprise 
Please, you're the lady in disguise 
Please, you're the only a friend I got 
Please, you'll be the last to see me rot 

Sick as a dog, what's your story
Sick as a dog, uum cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, 'cause ya really ain't that young

Please, it's a shame you're so refined 
Please, you was the last thing on my mind 
Please, don't be late to take it light 
Please, you're gonna bay into the night 

Sick as a dog, what's your story 
Sick as a dog, uum cat got your tongue
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry
Sick as a dog, 'cause you really ain't so young

Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Take it light
Say goodnight
Take it light
