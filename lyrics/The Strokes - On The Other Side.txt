I'm tired of everyone I know
Of everyone I see on the street and on TV
On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side

I hate them all, I hate them all
I hate myself for hating them
So I'll drink some more, I'll love them all, I'll drink even more
I'll hate them even more than I did before

On the other side, on the other side
Nobody's waiting for me on the other side

I remember when you came
You told me how to sing
Now it seems so far away
You told me how to sing

I'm tired of being so judgmental of everyone
And when the ghosts sleep, I will train my eyes to see
And my mind is as wide as the bird's on a tree

On the other side, on the other side
I know what's waiting for me on the other side
On the other side, on the other side
I know you're waiting for me on the other side
