I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you,
Anything you ask I do, for you
and only you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do

Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I leave it to you
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I want you to
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

Lap of the Gods
