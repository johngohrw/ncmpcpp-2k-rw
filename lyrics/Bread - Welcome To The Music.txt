Welcome to the music - welcome to the Guitar man
Know you're gonna love it - gonna do the best we can
And to help us along - think we're gonna need us a band

Lately we been playin' - travelin' in the jets and cars
Smilin' at the people - lookin'at the rock and roll stars
I tell you Carnegie Hall's better than those honky tonk bars

Well if it's true what music can do
To soothe the savage beast like they say
Well just relax and lie on your backs
'Cause beastly is the way we play

Now we're through talkin' - gonna speak another day
Love to play it funky - love to hear the symphony
And to star us along - Larry's gonna play it in "C"
Don't touch that dial - won't you come and stay for awhile.
