My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Your hoe shoulda never chose me, yea
And I shoulda never chose her, no
Now I'm in the same predicament that you was in back then when you was fuckin round with her
A hoe just gon' be a hoe, hoe
And a slut just gon' be a slut, slut
But now my money long, real, real, real long
And I just couldnâ€™t give two fucks, two fucks
You shoulda had a check bitch
Hold on a second
You coulda had a check bitch
Hey, shoulda, coulda, woulda, yea
Now I'm with my next bitch, next bitch
And you just another name on a checklist
These hoes been tossed and thrown round, yea
Bitch oh PU, you so foul
How you gon' do all that and then put your hair down, down
S.M.H. is really all I got to say about you
Don't call my phone asking can we start over, huh
She interrupted me countin' my money, I had to start over

[Hook x2:] 
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy] 
My ex bitch, must have been defected?
But my new bitch, look like Cinderella
She a dime bitch, ain't too much you can tell her
Upgrade everything, new whip, new bitch, new bezel
Got to lay a bitch out, it ain't nothin', I'm the real Hugh Hefner, hey
If it didn't work out, that's cool, cause my new bitch better, hey
Bitch you busted, it ain't no more red bottoms
No more overseas shopping, but yes, I still take that sloppy, sloppy
I know you see me in that 'rari cause it ain't no ceiling, no ceiling
When I see you in the city, it ain't no hard feelings
Hoe, you shoulda used your head bitch
Hey, you coulda had a check bitch

[Hook x2:]
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
My ex bitch, I'm shinin' on my ex bitch
