And in your life, there comes a darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to look back and you call on your knees
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now we're trapped we're dark cast people
We are helpless to this
In your darkest hour

But it was just a lie, just a lie
Just a lie, just a lie
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
It feels infinite

And in your life, there comes a darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to look back and you call on your knees
But there's a lighter sound, you'll never know
Now we're trapped we're dark cast people
We are helpless to this
In your darkest hour

We will never know
We will never know
So dark
So dark
So dark
So dark
