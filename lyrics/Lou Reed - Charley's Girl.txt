Everybody said that you'd better watch out
Man, she's gonna turn you in
And me, you know that I thought that I looked out
Now look at the trouble that I'm in
you know, you'd better -

Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl

It happened on New Year's Eve
They said everybody had to leave
They had a warrant in their hand
They wanted to bust the whole band
I said if I ever see Sharon again
I'm gonna punch her face in
you know you, you'd better -

Watch out for Charley's girl
hey, now, now
Watch out for Charley's girl
you know she'll turn you, turn you in
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
she'll turn you in you'd better, huhh -
Watch out, you'd better -
watch out, you'd better -
You'd better watch out, you'd better
you'd better watch out for -
Charley's girl
