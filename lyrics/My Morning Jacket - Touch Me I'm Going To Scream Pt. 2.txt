If you touch me
Well I just think I'll scream
'Cause it's been so long
Since someone challenged me

Made me think
'Bout the way things are
Made me think
About the way that you may be

I believe in
Love, my
Mmm...my love, mmm...my love
I don't even know why

Oh, this feeling is wonderful
Don't you ever turn it off
Oh, this feeling is wonderful
Don't you ever turn it off

Feeling
High on life
Human beings 
Heart beats

I can see it
By the way you smile
I'm smilin' too
I see myself in you

I am with this
When I am wise
mmm...my love, mmm...my love
Yeah, I don't even know why

Oh, this feeling is wonderful
Don't you ever turn it off
Ahh, this feeling is wonderful
Don't you ever turn it off

Ahh, oh yeah
Hooh, ahh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ahh

Ooh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh
Ooh, oh, oh
