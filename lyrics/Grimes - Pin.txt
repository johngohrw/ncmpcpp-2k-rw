Dirt on your fingernails, blood on your knees
But did that ever make you happy?
I think you were my best friend, gentle, do not apprehend
I know it hasn't been a dream, but if you pardon, I will mend

Drunk in a parking lot, just after 3
Tearin' at your hair like a banshee
Lighter and a safety pin, light the end, burn to skin
I'll stick to you forever, cause this scar, I think, is permanent

Ooh-ooh
Falling off the edge with you, ooh-ooh
It was too good to be true
Good to be true

Bite off your fingernails, cut off your skin
Tell me that it didn't happen
Running through the dark woods, falling, couldn't see straight
I was only looking for a human to reciprocate

Fade into black hole, I need it to breathe
But does it really make you happy?
Kiss me with a big knife, fighting hard off paradise
Led him like a soldier, beats in line, must be nice

Ooh-ooh
Falling off the edge with you, ooh-ooh
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true

Thought I had all I thought I wanted to
I fix him myself, falling way off course
And I can see your reflection when I look in mine
And I say, I say (I say)
Baby, don't go away

Falling off the edge with you, ahh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It was too good to be true
Ooh, falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true
