"Francis!
Francis! Be careful!"

Trying so hard to keep up with the Joneses
Running a rat racing won by our noses
Always put one foot in front of the other
And dance to the beat of the dacadent drummer

Just buy a brand new pair of Fred Astaire shoes
Climbing to the top, never gonna stop
It's the same old song and one two three and dec-a-dance

Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dancing to the dacadence dance, dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence dance

It's hard to stop once the music gets started
'Til the soles of your feet harden up like your heart did 
Stepping in line with the sign of the timer
Seduced by the tune of the decadent dancer

Just buy a brand new pair of Fred Astaire shoes
Climbing to the top, never gonna stop
It's the same old song and one two three and dec-a-dance

Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dancing to the dacadence dance, dance
Everybody decadancing
Dancing to the decadence
Dancing to the decadence dance
