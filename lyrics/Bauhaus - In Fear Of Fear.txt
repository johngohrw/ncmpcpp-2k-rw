You fear the lesson 
And fear to walk 
And fear to pass on 
Your fear to talk 

The teacher was feared 
Your parents too 
Then you became 
The fear of you 

Fear 

Look to yourself 
Climb over the wall 
And see behind 
That you're not so small 

Then you won't blame fear 
When competing's too much 
As you fall on your back 
As you fail to touch 

Fear 

And I say to you 
When your fear is strong 
When you fear your life 
Then your fear is wrong

Set free your past 
So shredding the skin 
Then you won't fear 
The fear of sin 

Fear
