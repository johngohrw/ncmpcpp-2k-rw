Hey Jack, I better shake it off, put her out of my head
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night
Oh brother, I left a woman in that morning bed
Been on that trip so many times
Good God, was it really yesterday?

I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm
Gonna love her way

Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, I gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby

That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

There was no rein to check me
When all of those little things walked on by
Oh, but I couldn't really stammer out a word
When that angel stuck in my mind
Looking for love won't hold me back
No, I'm gonna love her way

Come back, my babe
Come back, my babe
Be holy again, I gave her
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby

That kind of love, can only destroy
I gave her, maybe, maybe
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me

Just playing that latest record
Waiting for the telephone to ring
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive
No, no, no

I see her now a little tear running down her cheek
Lost, let down, people looking for me
I want to race down her street
And knock hard

Hard, hard on the door until
Until she breaks down into my arms like a
Treasured toy and I feel her pain
I'll be so strong, again and again

Come back my baby
I'm hold you again, I'll take you
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby

My kind of love, can only bring you joy, I'm gonna
Yeah, baby, baby, yeah, I'll give you baby, baby, baby
'Cos it's gonna be me, it's gonna be me
