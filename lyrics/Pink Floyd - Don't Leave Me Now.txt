Ooooh Babe 
Don't leave me now 
Don't say it's the end of the road 
Remember the flowers I sent 
I need you Babe 
To put through the shredder 
In front of my friends 
Ooooh Babe 
Don't leave me now 
How could you go? 
When you know how I need You 
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night 
Ooooh Babe 
Don't leave me now 
How can you treat me this way 
Running away 
Ooooh Babe 
Why are you running away? 
Ooooh Babe!
