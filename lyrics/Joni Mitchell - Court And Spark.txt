Love came to my door with a sleeping roll
And a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman to court and spark

He was playing on the sidewalk for passing change
When something strange happened
Glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made in People's Park
And went looking for a woman to court and spark

It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried sometimes
I worry sometimes

All the guilty people, he said, they've all seen the stain
On their daily bread
On their Christian names
I cleared myself, I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me, I'd complete you

His eyes were the colour of the sand and the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know
The more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A.
City of the fallen angels
