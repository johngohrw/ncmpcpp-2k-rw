I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens & the radio 
(Listening to the sirens & the radio)
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waitin' for his car on the hill
(Waitin' for his car on the hill)

He makes friends easy
He's not like me
I watch for judgment anxiously
Now where in the city
Can that boy be?
Waitin' for a car
Climbin', climbin'
Climbin' the hill

He's a real good talker
I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend 
(Fast tires come screaming around the bend)
But there's still no buzzer
They roll on
And I'm waitin' for his car on the hill
(Waitin' for his car on the hill)

You know he seemed so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter
When there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark
Waitin' for a car
Climbin', climbin'
Climbin' the hill
