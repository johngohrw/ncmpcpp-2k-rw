Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on?
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on?
Take a look it's on display for you
Coming down, no not today

Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up it’s on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pickin’ up but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We’ll find a place together
Fly on my wind

Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display for you
Comin’ down, no not today

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We’ll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We’ll find a place together

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa - do you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa - won't you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We’ll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We’re gonna live forever
Forever
