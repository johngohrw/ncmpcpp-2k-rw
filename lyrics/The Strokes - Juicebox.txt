Everybody sees me
But it's not that easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field

Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action over
Why won't you come over here?

Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love

Old time grudges
Will die so slowly
I know you messed up
When I saw you

You're cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Nobody can see me
Everything's too easy
Standing in the light field
Standing in the light field

Waiting for some action
Waiting for some action she said
“Why won't you come over here?”

Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love

Old time loves don't
Die so swiftly
You never trust me
For a while it was nice
But it's time to say bye

I'm cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

No no no cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

Oh no no no no cold
You're so cold
You're so cold
You're so cold

You're so cold
