Here shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
shall squeeze them tight like a fist 
And the walls shall have eyes 
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in their dark
And they'll play with our lives 

Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round Hark who are we 
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn 

Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights 
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows?
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows? 
Though the years spare them all

Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn 
Twirling us round and round 
and upside down
There's fear overhead 
There's fear overground 
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn
Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn 
Turning us round and round and round And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
