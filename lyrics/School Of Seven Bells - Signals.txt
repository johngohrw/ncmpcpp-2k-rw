I see you from far away, how could you
Feel so close, though I can't seem to reach you
I hold you in my mind like the barrel
Of a gun waiting to join the battle
Can't you see the smoke dance in the air
Signal was sent but you did not hear
Race begun but you can't run, your feet stuck
To the floor sinking down like a nightmare

Until I heard you
Until I felt your
Hands on my skin, I felt nothing
I know you see me
Why would you tease me
There's no game in what I'm feeling

Body twists like a snake under your song
Charm me 'til the congregations see us gone
No mouth kissing, you know this give me a chance
I'll give you everything so don't second guess
When I seek you out I go the distance
Come with me and don't try to resist this
There's no potion in the world to fix me
Up, no other magic to relieve this

Until I heard you
Until I felt your
Hands on my skin, I felt nothing
I know you see me
Why would you tease me
There's no game in what I'm feeling

Until I heard you
Until I felt your
Hands on my skin, I felt nothing
I know you see me
Why would you tease me
There's no game in what I'm feeling
