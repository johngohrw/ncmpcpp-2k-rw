In the middle of the party
Found a hole to be sorry
Through the glass
Drank a memory of her face

All the charm in the evening
Peridot television
Loveless another
Daughter and mother

Shut the door she'll have no more another vodka cocktail party
Her story unravels like a ribbon in the windy distance

Schoolgirls were praying
Lace curtains fading
Fern of the forest
Dearly beloved

Hard to hear she spit on you and made your bloody nose more bloody
Shut the door she'll have no more another vodka cocktail party

Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
I need to leave

Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
I need to leave it

Totems in the night
I want to forget
All that wasn't right
She needs to leave it
