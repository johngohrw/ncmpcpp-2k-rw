Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine
I left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
And now I'm stuck, still wondering how it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade

Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
