Because soon the flowers will close up and sleep peacefully
Because soon the ADHD kids will quiet down respectfully
Because soon the tractors will drive themselves on orderly hills
Because soon the pineal eye the pineal eye a penny a lie selah selah

I turn your ashes to gold
You repay me with vitriol
I allow your eyelashes to grow
You repay me with vitriol
I induce your honor sash to glow
You repay me with vitriol
Vitriol

Soon the yellow teeth will be fresh breath white
Soon money will be paper and success will be a crime
Soon the same jacket will fit every shoulder
Soon all the guys get into art school
Soon the cats will sing to their litter
Soon the trumpets will all melt together
Soon all the alloys will be separated
Soon jehova will part the waters
Soon the delicacies will be sprinkled with sea salt
Soon the media will try to be honest
Soon religions will love one another
Shoulder to shoulder
Primordial gender no more
Li and chi will kiss one another soon
Yin and Yang collapse together soon
Embryo

Soon form an content will cleave to one another
Soon thought will spurt out into expression
Soon contraception will conquer the earth
Soon cherubim give birth to single parents
Soon gauze will cover the caskets
Soon I'll rule this anthill at last
Soon I'll run this racket at last
Soon the reason to go on living will be obvious
Soon the future will glitter with promise
Soon the range will be roved by wild horse
Free spirits
Assertive but respectful
Comfortable but not bored
Soon creation will finish its process
Soon all struggles will be recreational
And it will be time to arrive at a higher beginning
And let some other sufferer take it from here
Take it from here from here from here

Because soon the flowers will close up and sleep peacefully
Because soon the ADHD kids will quiet down respectfully
Because soon the tractors will drive themselves on orderly hills
Because soon the pineal eye the pineal ey a penny a lie selah selah

I turn your ashes to gold
You repay me with vitriol
I allow your eyelashes to grow
You repay me with vitriol
I induce your honor sash to glow
You repay me with vitriol
Vitriol
