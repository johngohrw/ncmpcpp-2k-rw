And I wont make love to you
But I Feel love fell love

Jailhouse gets empty
Rudy gets plenty
The baton stick gets shorter
Rudy gets taller
Cant fight against the youth
Cause we're strong and the rude rude people
Cant fight against the youth
Casuse we're strong and the rude rude people

Baby get down
When I was a youth in 1983
It was the best day of my life, had the 89 vision
We didnt fuss or no fight
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife
It was playin on my guitar, on my guitar

I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there

When the rhythm playin
I know that I'm gonna be there yeah
Bud Gaugh will be singing there
And Eric Wilson will be bangin up there, yea
And we'll be all singin...with version, with version

Reagge version
Version, Version, Version oh

What has been told to the wise and up-rooted
Its gonna be revealed unto, and Sublime
Rudy Rudy Rudy
Cant fight against the youth, right now
Them are rude, rude people
Cant fight against the resistance, oh right now
Them are rude, rude people

We gonna rule this land among children
We gonna rule this land...

Cause when that rhythm it was playin on my guitar
On my guitar

I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there

When I was a youth it was the best day
It was the best day of my life
We had the 89' vision

We didnt fuss or no fight
When all the little daughters wanna be my wife
When that rhythm it was playin on my guitar
On my guitar

I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
I had to be there
Had to be there...

Jailhouse gets empty
Rudy gets plenty
Baton stick gets shorter
Rudy gets taller, taller
And fight against the youth
Cause we're strong, them are rude, rude people
Cant fight against the youth
