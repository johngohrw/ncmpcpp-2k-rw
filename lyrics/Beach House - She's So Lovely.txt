She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is everything for you

From the way that her eyes are shaped
It's making me sick

With her head on my shoulder
Waking up barely just to believe

For her dinner
Baby pink lavender
Leather white umbrella sinner

She's so lovely
Everything about her
Mannerisms of another

Castles in the sand
Money in your hand
And all I have to do
Is stay away from you
