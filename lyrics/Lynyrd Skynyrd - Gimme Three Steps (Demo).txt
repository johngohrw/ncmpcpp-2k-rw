I was cutting the rug 
Down at a place called The Jug 
With a girl named Linda Lu 
When in walked a man 
With a gun in his hand 
And he was looking for you know who. 
He said, "Hey there fellow, 
With the hair colored yellow, 
Watcha tryin' to prove? 
'Cause that's my woman there 
And I'm a man who cares 
And this might be all for you."

I was scared and fearing for my life. 
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree. 
'Cause he was lean, mean, 
Big and bad, Lord, 
Pointin' that gun at me. 
I said, "Wait a minute, mister, 
I didn't even kiss her. 
Don't want no trouble with you. 
And I know you don't owe me 
But I wish you'd let me 
Ask one favor from you."

[Chorus]
"Won't you give me three steps, 
Gimme three steps mister, 
Gimme three steps towards the door? 
Gimme three steps 
Gimme three steps mister, 
And you'll never see me no more."

Well the crowd cleared away 
And I began to pray 
As the water fell on the floor. 
And I'm telling you son, 
Well, it ain't no fun 
Staring straight down a forty-four. 
Well he turned and screamed at Linda Lu 
And that's the break I was looking for. 
And you could hear me screaming a mile away 
As I was headed out towards the door.

[Chorus]
