Well, it's ever so funny
'Cause I don't think you're special, I don't think you're cool
You're just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And I'm struggling
I can't see through your fake tan
Yeah, and you know it for a fact
That everybody's eating out of your hands

But what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you don't know nothing

Well, fancy seeing you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well, I haven't seen you since last year
Yeah, surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it
Yeah, and you knew it all along
Oh, and you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on, tell me I'm wrong

So what do you know?
Oh, you know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

So what do you know?
Yeah, you don't know nothing
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Oh, yeah, I'll still take you home
I said what do you know?
Oh, you don't know nothing, no

I fancy you with a passion
You're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
But you're a fad, you're a fashion
And I'm having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright
Yeah, I'll put it on one side
'Cause everybody's looking
You've got control of everyone's eyes, including mine
