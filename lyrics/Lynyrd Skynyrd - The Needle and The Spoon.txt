Thirty days, lord and thirty nights 
I'm comin' home on an airplane flight 
Mama waitin' at the ticket line 
Tell me son why do you stand there cryin'

[chorus]
It was the needle and the spoon 
And a trip to the moon 
Took me away, took me away

I've been feelin' so sick and tired 
Got to get better, lord before I die 
Seven doctors couldn't help my head, they said 
You better quit, son before your dead

[chorus]
Quit the needle. Quit the spoon 
Quit the trip to the moon 
We gonna take you away. Lord, we gonna take you away 

[spoken]
It was the needle and the spoon 

I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool 
But then again, lord I've seen a lot of fools 
Well, I hope you people, lord can hear what I say 
You'll have your chance to hit it some day

[chorus]
Don't mess with the needle or a spoon 
Or any trip to the moon 
It'll take you away

Lord, their gonna bury you boy 
Don't mess with the needle 
Now I know, I know, I know...
