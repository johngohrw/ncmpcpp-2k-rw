Let's just forget
Everything said
And everything we did
Best friends and better halves

Goodbyes
And the autumn night
When we realized
We were falling out of love

There were some things
That were said
That weren't meant
But were said

Like we never did
Not to be
Overly
Dramatic

I just think it's best
'Cause you can't miss what you forget

So let's just pretend
Everything and anything
Between you and me
Was never meant
