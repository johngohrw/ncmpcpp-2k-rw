When a new life turns towards you
And the night becomes a bay
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets his way
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain and the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain and the sea and the hours
 
When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me     
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives
 
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun and the trees and the birth
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun and the trees and the birth
 
I am still here two days later
Same place, same time
And I'm stuck here two years too long
Same place, the wrong time
 
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain and the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The sun and the sea and the hours
 
Their love died three years ago
Spoken words I cannot show
