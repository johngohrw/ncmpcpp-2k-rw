What I need is good advice cooked on plates of ground meat
Rubber hands and silly friends pasted on my wall
Someone salt a sweet sea soup that I could swim in proudly
We might swim like laughing ducks in your pink light glow

There we go changing again, there we go again

My hands can make yours warm again if not absorbed in blankets
Are you in need of teen angst and nibble on your neck?
And if I had volcano boots for swimming in volcanoes
Do you know the origins of laughing ducks? Oh what's a matter with those birds

There we go changing again, there we go again

What you need's a happy farm with happy goats and sheep
What I need's a happy arm to swing ya 'round like father
