Come on, little boy
I am your friend
And I understand
The pain you're in

You've seen your mom come
Come home dreaming
In the rain, when you wash
You can't fade it

Come on, little boy
You don't need to cry
You don't need to cry your eyes out, cry your eyes out
Come on, kid
Keep your head up and sigh
You don't need to understand
The reasons why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh
