Wait (disgrace)
I know I shouldn't, but we'll wait (such a pretty face)
I know the time is getting late (... such a waste)
And here is what you hesitate (such a pretty face)
But still I really wish that you'd wait (... such a waste)
Although the passion might abate (such a pretty face)
And find you in another state (it's such a state)
That will seem just as a mistake (it's such a waste)
Oh baby, I really think that I oughta wait (such a pretty face)

Wait (it was such a waste)
I really wouldn't want your hate (it's such a pretty face)
Certainly not after like late (... such a waste)
You wanna give not only take  (it's such a pretty face)
I know propriety is such a waste (it's such a disgrace)
But then it says you really have to wait (such a pretty face)
Considering the present state (... such a waste)
Don't change my mind at such a late stage (... such a waste)
Oh baby, don't you think you oughta wait (such a pretty face)

Ooohhh ...
Ooohhh ...
Ooohhh ...
Ooohhh ...

Wait
Oh, now baby, how I wish you would wait
I really wish you'd hesitate
Oh, baby, baby please why don't you wait
Oh, how I really wish you'd wait
Oh, how I wish you'd hesitate
...
...

(... someday)
