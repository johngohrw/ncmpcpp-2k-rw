I hear it doubly clear

There’s a doubled exposure
Just waiting to happen
I’m sitting and fading
Rain tapping together

Two licks of the dog bone
Me slipping through belt loops
You running ahead of
The sound coming after

I hear it doubly clear
Two mannequins in the window
Suit up like twins on day one
Loud harks in the grandest canyon

Natural slap the world back at ya
It’s placing the mirror
And you will hear her

Throw two hacks attempting to chip it
Return of the bat crack
In a place called Camden

On delay two of us together
On delay the sweet of the double
On delay me right behind you
On delay my steps will follow

On delay two eyes that appeared there
You saw them both times
On delay looking at reflections
And you were one of them

And it was so nice
And it happened twice

A place that’s thrice best leading me into a feedback zone in which I lose time I’m finding new rhythms to hold on

So turned on by the delay
So turned on by the delay
