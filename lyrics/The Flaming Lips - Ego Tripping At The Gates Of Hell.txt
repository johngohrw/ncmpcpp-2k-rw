I was waiting on a moment
But the moment never came
All the billion other moments
We're just slipping all away
I must have been tripping
Just ego tripping

I was wanting you to love me
But your love it never came
All the other love around me
Was just wasting all away
I must have been tripping
Just ego tripping

I was waiting on a moment
But the moment never came -
But the moment never came -
