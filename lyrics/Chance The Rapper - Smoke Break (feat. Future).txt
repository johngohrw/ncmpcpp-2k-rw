[Intro - Chance The Rapper:]
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a, we just
Fuck is going on? When did we buy a bowl?

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
We just be smoking a bowl
We ain't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
There don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her...

[Hook - Chance The Rapper:]
Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down oh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down oh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoked a fatty sing Zoo-Wap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

[Hook - Chance The Rapper:]
Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down oh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break

[Verse 3 - Future:]
I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding your back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down oh
I got to lay back the roof
I got to break the new rules
She can't be taking no cost
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me my mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give a perc full of steam
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and geuss
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can...

[Hook - Chance The Rapper & Future:]
Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down oh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve, we deserve
A smoke break
