There we were now here we are
All this confusion nothings the same to me
There we were now here we are
All this confusion nothings the same to me 

But I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is oh so! new to me
No I can't sell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is oh so! new to me 

What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs but they're not very clear
What I heard is not what I hear
I can see the signs but they're not very clear 

This is confusion am I confusing you?
