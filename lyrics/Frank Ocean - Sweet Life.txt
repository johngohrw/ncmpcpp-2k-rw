The best song wasn’t the single, but you weren’t either
Livin’ in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water’s blue, swallow the pill

Keepin’ it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin’ it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain’t HD, that’s too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches and limes, the sweet life

Sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

You’ve had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

The best song wasn’t the single, but you couldn’t turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can’t seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You’re catching that breeze ’til you’re dead in the grave

But you’re keepin’ it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin’ it surreal, not sugar-free, my tv ain’t HD, that’s too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches and lime, a sweet life

A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

You’ve had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born, yeah
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world, when you got the beach

And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It’s everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin’ trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin’ ape shit crazy

You’ve had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don’t know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
