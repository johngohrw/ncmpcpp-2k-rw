If time had a place
And space for your past
Like a little novel
You wanted to read again and again
Would I be in your novel?
Would I begin and end in it?

If I had a place
And space for your little boy eyes
Could you really believe?
I certainly dare you
I do not want to scare you
Anymore

Oh, what a fuss when the king rides by
Oh, what a fuss when the king rides
Straight through my heart
Straight through my life

Need your love more than you'll ever know

A light kiss, the touch of your hand
A million things I will never understand
Oh, what a fuss when the king trades in
Oh, what a fuss when the king trades

All of my love
For someone else's hand
Need your love more than you'll ever know

You don't miss your water
You don't miss your water
'Til your well is gone
