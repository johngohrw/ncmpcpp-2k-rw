Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo

There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo

We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, 
From paradise 
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball. 
Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo 

After all, after all
