Oh baby don't you know I suffer
Oh baby can't you hear me moan?
You caught me under false pretenses
How long before you let me go?

Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
(Ooh, you set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the...
(Ooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive 

I thought I was a fool for no one
Ooh baby I'm a fool for you
You're the queen of the superficial
And how long before you tell the truth

Ooh, you set my soul alight
Ooh, you set my soul alight

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive 
(You set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the...
(Ooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive

Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole

Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive 
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the supermassive
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
(You set my soul alight)
Glaciers melting in the dead of night
And the superstars sucked into the...
(Ooh, you set my soul...)
Into the supermassive

Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
Supermassive black hole
