When I hear them use your name
I get all choked up inside
It's not only from the shame
It's like 10 different lovers died
Except you're still just a mile away
But there's nothing left to say

Don't leave us not in love again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little strain in the pouring rain
It washed away most everything

If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When there's nothing left to say

Don't leave us not in love again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little strain in the pouring rain
It washed away most everything
[x2]

Don't leave us not in love again
The little girl can't comprehend
She had another dream that her mama's gone
She's alright, but you're all wrong
