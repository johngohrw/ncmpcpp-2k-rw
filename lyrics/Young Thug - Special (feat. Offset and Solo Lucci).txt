[Hook - Young Thug:]
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that
She keep on her Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pencil
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger tigger

[Verse 1 - Young Thug:]
My diamonds they shine of course
Fuck her with a charlie horse
Pull up let Lil' Dolly bust
Four fives in them Cali cups
My cars all like Need for Speed
My feet on some Mickey D's
He clutching he acting crazy
She want Lil' Lucci to leave
I told her he can not go
He got to stay with me with 44s
My forgis on top like rollercoast
These fuck niggas load up slower than Rollie-pollies
DJ Sky flying higher
YSL never tell no choir
She want to fuck on my [?]
I'm ninja lil' nigga
Tell 'em or tell something
Walking in with bands on us
Big B but Channel on us
Laced up with some Ls on us
Motherfucker go crazy drop down we still on him
And I really, really, really can't tell prepare for jail on 'em

[Hook - Young Thug:]
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow

Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that

[Verse 2 - Solo Lucci:]
Pull up in a Tesla, even that shit don't impress her

She on her knees like she want me to bless her
I try to get in her drawer like a dresser
I fuck that bitch like I'm trying to impress her

He blood like we brothers
You niggas ain't tough you fuck one up we gon' bust like a bubble

[Verse 3 - Offset:]
I got a K and its special just like its a cereal
I'm looking down on your peasants because I'm the king and I'm the superior
You know I got shooters on top of the roof and you think that I'm playing I'm serious
I'm on them percocets and vicodins
I'm adding the money not minusing
I got a bad bitch look like Kylie Jenner
Its a millionaire club and you not a member
We slaying your hoe put that dick up in her
Don't try me lil' nigga I recommend it
Fifty thousand for the Audemar Piguet
You think about robbing nigga better abort the mission like you killing children
Cause I got that semi Grinch throw Christmas and my shooter through your chimney
She fucked the star and tried to keep the condom
I fucked that hoe after hours like a [?]
Coca coca coming from Tijuana
My wrists is sick sometimes I want to vomit
Got that pump in my truck I ain't talking about Donald
I want an island bitch, come here, Rihanna
I got out of jail screaming, "Fuck you, your honor!"

[Hook - Young Thug:]
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
