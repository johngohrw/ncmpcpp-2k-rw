I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend the guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar
 
It's just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz 
And you're bound to trip and she'll detect the fiction on your lips
And dig a contradiction up

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time
 
I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes that will get you back to normal
 
And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch the varnish off
That newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon

And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones and in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled with the wrong memories?  
 
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt in between the dirt
