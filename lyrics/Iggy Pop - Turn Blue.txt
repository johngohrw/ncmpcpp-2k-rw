See a black Eldorado
Oh, rolling along down below my window
That black girl in the back looks pretty good
Christ! She's beautiful
You know how soft she is
Just what you feel like

Oh, I'm so far away from her
Jesus this is Iggy
You, you might as well come with me,
When you ride the ride
There's talk and I don't wanna talk

Oh mamma, I shot myself down [x4]

They're stepping on our hearts
Stepping on our hearts
I don't know why they're stepping on our hearts
Damn, I don't know why
Stepping on our hearts [x5]
Can't you see, oh no, Stepping on our hearts

How come the blacks, how come they copy you so good?
They get off on you, so ?
If you wanna make it
Young man you gotta make somebody come
Come out of your black [x2] and strong
Black! Strong! Black!

Jesus it's cold in this room, it's really cold
You know I never told you about this, but there's one guy
Somebody I really love, he's never around
Well he was taking things that could be alright, that could be nice
And make him ugly, so damn ugly
And we put out the lights on them
Yeah, we'd make it dark, we put out the lights....on them
It's idiots like you that screw me up
I know there's nothing to you
And I don't know why I treat you so kind
Come down and dance with me, dance with me
You got nobody left but me
Oh accept me, don't reject me, don't forget me
Mamma, what colour will the lights be? Will they turn blue on me? [x2]
Mamma, I shot myself up, woh mamma, I shot myself up, up, up, mamma
Up down, up down mamma
Oh oh oh oh oh mamma
I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't mean to, but I did it, I shot myself up
Mamma I shot myself!
