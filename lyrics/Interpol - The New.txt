I wish I could live free
Hope it's not beyond me
Settling down takes time
One day we'll live together
And life will be better
I have it here, yeah, in my mind
Baby, you know someday you'll slow
And baby, my hearts been breaking.

I gave a lot to you
I take a lot from you too
You slave a lot for me
Guess you could say I gave you my edge

But I can't pretend I don't need to defend some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time lying

You're looking all right tonight
I think we should go
