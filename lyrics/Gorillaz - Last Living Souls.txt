Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Take a gun
Or how you say
That's no way you behave

Just a law, a new begin
Sing a song that doesn't sin
And it grows
Hey, you know

Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last to get away to some another day?
Do we know
Well, we know
Doesn't seem to be complete

Are we, are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?
Are we the last living souls?

Get up, get up, get up, get up...

What you say?
Cause all I was on
I got it down wrong
I see myself to get
And the Lord, seeing all now
Can you take us in
The part that comin' on
The coldest man doesn't see it's all

We go to the car
I see you walk to the far
And when you get there do you see
You fit the last you need on me

Cause we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
Yeah, we're the last living souls
We're the last living souls
