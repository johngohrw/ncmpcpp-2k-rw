Right
Now
ha ha ha ha ha...

I am an antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy passer by

Cause I
Wanna be
Anarchy
No dogs body

Anarchy for the UK
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time stop at traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

Cause I
I wanna be
Anarchy
In the city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best
I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy

Cause I
Wanna be
Anarchy
It's the only way to be

Is this the M.P.L.A
Or is this the U.D.A
Or is this the I.R.A
I thought it was the UK
Or just
Another
Country
Another council tenancy

I wanna be
Anarchy
And I wanna be
Anarchy
Know what I mean
And I wanna be
Anarchist
Get pissed
Destroy
