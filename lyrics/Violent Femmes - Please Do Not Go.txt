Tell ya, man, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
Of course to me, she mean all t' world
But then she like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry

So please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go

How long can the days go on when my love is so strong?
And I know I cannot tell a lie, I want to see him go bye
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Now I wonder, I wonder what she would say
If I told her, if I told her I felt this way
You know it might make her turn, might make her turn
Might make her turn either way
So all I can do is patiently pray, pray, pray, pray, pray

So please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go

How long can the days go on when my love is so strong?
And I know I cannot tell a lie, I want to see him go bye
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

I'll tell you, man, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
And y'know I'd travel, I could travel over the whole world
And you know what she does, she turn around and like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry

Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, I've got something to show
