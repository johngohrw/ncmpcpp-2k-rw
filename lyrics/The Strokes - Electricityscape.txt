Oh with strangers to impress so near
Old friends don't realize I'm here
I wish two drinks were always in me
I pretend I had the perfect ear

Take me to the water
Make me understand that I was wrong
For me tomorrow is my first day
So please don't tempt me in the wrong way

It's almost after midnight
I can see the city lights, we're here

Change your mind tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio

Well I swear I'll give it back tomorrow
But for now I think that I'll just borrow

All the chords from that song
And all the words from that other song
I heard yesterday

Change your mind, tonight
You belong to the city now
And you're closer now, I know
You belong on the radio

I will not disturb you
I was just returning you the compliment
