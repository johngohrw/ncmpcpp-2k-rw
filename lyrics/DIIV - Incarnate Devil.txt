Its today and its in a word
I breathe and seethe
Fade to zero
I’m misinformed
I’m barely born
Gone to the void
With the incarnate devil and a talking snake

"Here in this spring storm, stars float along the void…"

Here he comes
Today
Its written on my face
A clue
A tunnel you can look right through
It’ll take
Some time in line
With the incarnate devil
And a talking snake
