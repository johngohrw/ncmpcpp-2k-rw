Trudging through the morning and the tramp with the trampoline under his arm, shifts past your whiskers so stark is the charm but the barking alarm waits coiled until the corner is turned

And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move round in your muddy mind blatantly caked and unwilling to wind uncooperative time so he sits on the springs until the muck goes dry

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

What came first the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk, your legs start running and your head gets caught

Canopy 19 is perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away I am unhappy to say, behold is the crook in the hammock plays

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Behold there's a crook in the hammock plays cruelly with the base of the scales
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
