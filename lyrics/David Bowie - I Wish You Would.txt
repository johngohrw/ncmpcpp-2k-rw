Early in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving
won't do me no good

Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do?
Turning on me and some other men too

Come back baby give me one more chance
You know I still love
you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance all night long
In my arms, oh yeah

[CHORUS]

Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah [repeat ad inf.]
