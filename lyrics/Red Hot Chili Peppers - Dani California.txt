Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper
And Mama was a hippie

In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama

She never knew that there was
Anything more than poor

What in the world does your
Company take me for

Black bandana sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana

She’s a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin’
Baby what you gonna

Looking down the barrel of a
Hot metal 45
Just another way to survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest

She’s a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin’ when
It got a little brighter

With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come
When I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded she was
Stealin’ another breath
I love my baby to death

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest

Who knew the other side of you
Who knew what others died to prove
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say say say

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin'
For the quota

Down in the Badlands
She was savin’ the best for last

It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She’s my priestess; I'm your priest
