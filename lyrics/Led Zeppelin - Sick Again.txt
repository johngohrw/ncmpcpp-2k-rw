From the window of your rented limousine, I saw your pretty blue eyes 
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen, Painted lady in the city of lies. 

Oh, do you know my name? Do I look the same 
You know I'm the one you want. I must be the one you need, yeah 

Clutching pages from your teenage dream In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise 
Through the circus of the L.A. queens. How fast your learn the downhill side 

Oh, do you know my name? Do I look the same 
You know I'm the one you want. I must be the one you need,. 

Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen, Come on, flash it in my eyes 
Said you dug me since you were thirteen,Then you giggle as you heave and sigh. 

Oh, do you know my name? Do I look the same 
You know I'm the one you want. I must be the one you need. 

Hours, hours, and the moments in between, Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times 
the fun of comin', oh the pain in leavin', Baby, dry those silver eyes 

Oh, do you know my name? Do I look the same 
You know I'm the one you want. I must be the one you need, 

Ooh, that's right.
