You're My Only HomeThe Magnetic FieldsI will stay if you let me stayAnd I'll go if you let goBut I won't go far awayBecause you're my only homeAnd I will hide what you want hiddenAnd I'll roam if you say roamBut I'd just as soon you didn'tBecause you're my only homeWhen you cancel dinner plansWhen you cross the street and you don't take my handWhen you make impossible demands I wish I didn't understandI will stay if you let me stayAnd I'll go if you let goBut I won't go far awayBecause you're my only homeI will hide what you want hiddenAnd I'll roam if you say roamBut I'd just as soon you didn'tBecause you're my only home[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:You%27re_My_Only_Home ]
