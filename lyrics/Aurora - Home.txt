I’m growing tired and I’m growing old
And the road I walk, I walk alone
And I wonder if and I think I might
Take a look, take a look on the other side

For five days I will walk away
From the lonely life, I am done with pain
And I wonder if and I think I might
Take a look, take a look on the other side

Just one look

All my demons
Greeting me here as a friend
Oh...
I’m home
Waiting for time to let go
Peace in my body and soul
Oh...

Oh, oh

Born to live
And I know I’ve tried
To keep myself in peace with time
Without control at all in life
I’ll be fine, I’ll be fine on the other side

Pack my bags
I know the road
I write the words and here I go
Towards the peace I need to find
I’ll be fine, I’ll be fine on the other side

All my demons
Greeting me here as a friend
Oh...
I’m home
Waiting for time to let go
Peace in my body and soul
Oh...

I meet the eyes
I recognise how they have changed with time
I find myself surrounded by a coffin in the night
I meet the eyes
I recognise how they have changed with time
I find myself surrounded by a coffin in the night

All my demons
Greeting me here as a friend
Oh...
I’m home
Waiting for time to let go
Peace in my body and soul
Oh...

I meet the eyes
I recognise how they have changed with time
I find myself surrounded by a coffin in the night

Oh
Body and soul
Oh...
Oh, oh
