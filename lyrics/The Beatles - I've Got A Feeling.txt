I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide
No no no, oh no, oh no
Yeah yeah I've got a feeling yeah

Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah
And if you leave me I won't be late again
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Yeah yeah I've got a feeling yeah
I've got a feeling

All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody
Who looked like you

I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah I've got a feeling yeah
Yeah

Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sunshine
Oh yeah, (oh yeah) oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up
Everybody put their foot down
Oh yeah
Yeah I've got a feeling
A feeling deep inside
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

I've got a feeling
A feeling I can't hide
Oh no

Oh no no no

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I've got a feeling

I've got a feeling

Everybody had a good year
Everybody had a hard time

Everybody had a wet dream

Everybody saw the sunshine

Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down

Everybody pulled their socks up

Everybody put the foot down
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

I've got a feeling
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

(Oh my soul, so hard.)
