Leave me alone
I'm in control
I'm in control
And girls lie too much
And boys act too tough
Enough is enough

Well, on the minds
Of other men
I know she was...

I said, "Just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it"

That's right

Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna break your back for a chance
He's gonna steal your friends if he can
He's gonna win someday

I fell off the track, now
I can't go back
I'm not like that

Boys lie too much
Girls act too tough
Enough is enough

Well on the minds
Of other girls
I know he was...

I said, "Just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it"

That's right

Oh, he's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna break your back for a chance
He's gonna steal your friends if he can
He's gonna win someday

Oh, he will...
