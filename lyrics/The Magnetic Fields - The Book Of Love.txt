The Book Of LoveThe Magnetic FieldsThe book of love is long and boring No one can lift the damn thing It's full of charts and facts and figures And instructions for dancing But I, I love it when you read to me And you, you can read me anything The book of love has music in it In fact that's where music comes from Some of it is just transcendental Some of it is just really dumb But I, I love it when you sing to me And you, you can sing me anythingThe book of love is long and boring And written very long ago It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes And things we're all too young to know But I, I love it when you give me things And you, you ought to give me wedding rings I, I love it when you give me things And you, you ought to give me wedding rings[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:The_Book_Of_Love ]
