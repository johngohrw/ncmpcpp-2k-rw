[Verse 1 - Ralo:]
Had a talk with Thug, we was talkin’ bout Escobar (Pablo!)
Snitches the only thing a rich nigga stressin’ for
Remember we was riding on the motorbus
They'd rob the bank before they think ‘bout robbing us
We did this shit ourself, we ain’t ask for no help
He’ll kill for for real, I’ll kill for lil Jeff
So now we got right, these niggas went left
Ridin’ ‘round with them straps, I ain’t talkin’ seat belts
I swear to god I’ll murk ‘em if Thugger say the word
We went from robbing these niggas to selling bricks and birds
They had the nerve to say they don’t like me riding with Thug
But at first, they liked to see a friend in clubs

Smash Brothers said we bool
Roll up some opps and wood

Too turnt up for Lil NuNu
My niggas demons voodoo
They facing shit like ooVoo, yeah
Free the gang, we the gang
And the chain made of chain
We insane, keep a Glock
If you strayin’, bow bow
Rob me, nah nah

Hundred shots in the daytime if you ever come play with them, my boy
Ain’t no shootin’ up no random houses, got to get your man, you got to kill that boy
Free Tre, one of the first niggas to ever put me in that field, my boy
Took cases be just , my boy
Police chasin’, we juuged my boy

How we rocking the [?]
Y’all still fucking around and got a fresh seven
Man this shit kinda hectic
Painful living, growing up missing daddy
