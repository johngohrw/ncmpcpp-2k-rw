who's that talking in the library
who's that talking in my library 
is that you 
no i won't put you out 
cuz what would this place be without my muse 
nothing special 
every book in here i wrote 
some i'm not too proud of 
some i wish i could burn 
so many pages i wrote 
wish i could revise them 
but there's no erasing 
and the best advice i got 

was keep writing 
and keep living 
and keep loving 
(oh lovin lovin lovin)
and when the ink dries 
and the pages turn to dust 
so will we 
turn to dust 
so will we 
dust dust 

who's that laughing in my library 
who's that laughing in my library 
is that you 
no i wont put you out 
cause what would this place be 
without your smile 
nothing special 
i fell in love with you girl 
you let yourself inside 
with no respect for privacy  
you said there's too much on my mind
then you ripped out a page 
and set that shit on flame 

i quit writing 
i kept living 
i kept loving 
and when the ink dries 
and them pages turn to dust 
so will we 
turn to dust 
so will we 
dust dust
