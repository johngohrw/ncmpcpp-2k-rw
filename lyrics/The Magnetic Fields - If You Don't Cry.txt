If You Don't CryThe Magnetic FieldsSoftly the crystals falling on 17th Street do their dance and die and are goneMillions of crystal balls roll around your feet and nothing gets doneAn hour goes by, she doesn'tIf you don't cry it isn't loveIf you don't cry then you just don't feel it deep enoughDying all day in thousands of little ways, dancing alone and drinking a lotClosing the clubs and haunting the cabarets looking for whatAnother five years off your lifeIf you don't cry it isn't loveIf you don't cry then you just don't feel it deep enoughA year goes by, she doesn'tIf you don't cry it isn't loveIf you don't cry then you just don't feel it deep enoughIf you don't cry it isn't loveIf you don't cry then you just don't feel it deep enough[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:If_You_Don%27t_Cry ]
