Shoes that no man would want to wear 
Wipe away the night's last cold stare 
Red fist curled 'round the house 
Was away boy Shelly's shoes 
wash 

Chocolate power is so crisp 
The atomic open house is really here 
And we have gone so desperate 
Your power knows no bounds 
And heavier with time 
Are our shoes 
That no man would want to wear 
New tread wipes a wet road so dry 
it stings 

Into the borrowed course 
Under the dreadful birds 
Under the singing soil 
And all those guilty clouds 

I have seen too much 
Wipe away my eyes 
Too much
