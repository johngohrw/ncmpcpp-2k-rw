Nerve ends tick in flicker book animation
One eye's closed in fear, anticipation
Will it stay shut?  Will it ever open?
What if?
What if?

Nerves.
Tell tale tongues lick at seven senses
Brittle spittle sparks you are defenseless
The fabric of dreams is ripped apart
Nerves.
As you feel the twist of the shadowed dagger
In your pumping heart

Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel

Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel

Sense of serenity is shattered in the glint of splintered glass.
A trail of random cutlery cuts a dash in the concrete underpass
Nerves.

Nerves.

Nerves.
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
