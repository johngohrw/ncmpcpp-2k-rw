You, since that magic day
We've been like magnets in a play
We smash in then pull away
Every day

You, you're a jet, a flying gun
You kill me softly with your sun
You melt my wings and call it fun
I should run

Faster and faster
I should run
Faster and faster
From your arms

I watch my powers die
Falling out of starry skies
You kryptonite my life
Every night

The ending of this road
Dashing prince or horny toad?
Who really ever knows?
I should know

Faster and faster
I should run
Faster and faster
From your arms

Mmm, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm running
shaking like a schizo
'Lectric sheep are dancing in the window
My heart beats
It's kicking like a kick drum
Am I a freak?
Or just another weirdo
Call me weak
Or just call me your hero

You can't zap down all my good times
I know right from wrong
Kissing loving's feeling good
And not this feeling down
You hide your chainsaw deep in kisses
That don't make it quiet
You got em running, muttering, screaming, each and every night

Faster and faster
I should run
Faster and faster
From your arms
