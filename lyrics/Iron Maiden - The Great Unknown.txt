Winter softly falling to the ground
Calmly waiting don't you hear a sound
When the world has fallen to the depths below
Where the future's open and the fear has grown
And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown

In the selfish hearts of some
The nightmare's coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through
Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met
To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor's anger
Of the lesson ringing true
And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end

Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
Begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and end of us all

Where the fools are lying
And the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone
Where the sons are dying
Hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and end of us all

When the world has fallen
And we stand alone...
