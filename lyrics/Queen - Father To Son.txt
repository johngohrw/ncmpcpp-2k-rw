A word in your ear, from father to son
hear the words that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

And the voice is so clear, time after time it leeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see, your country to be
Just keep on building on the ground that's been won

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son

Take this letter that I give you,
Take it sonny, hold it high
You won't understand a word that's in it
But you'll write it all again before you die
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you, will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
Sing if you will -
But the air you breathe I live to give you

Father to son
Father to, father to, father to son

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
From father to son, to son...
