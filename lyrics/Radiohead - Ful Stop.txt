You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
But you can take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?

This is a foul tasting medicine
A  foul tasting medicine
Still trapped in your full stop
Two fools stop
Two fools stop
Two fools stop
Two fools
Two fools
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools
(All the good times)
Two fools
Two fools

Take me back
Take me back again
Take me back
Take me back again
You really me
Really mess
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time
