He won't make love to me now
Not now, I've set the fee
He said it's too much in pounds
I guess I'm stuck with me

He told me I was so small
I told him "Water me"
I promise I can grow tall
When making love is free

He won't make love to me now
Not now, I've set the fee
He said it's too much in pounds
I guess I'm stuck with me

He told me I was so small
I told him "Water me"
