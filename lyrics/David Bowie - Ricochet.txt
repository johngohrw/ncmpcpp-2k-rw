Like weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - Ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures 
so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep

Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts, things like that
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet - It's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil 
breaking parole
Ricochet - Ricochet
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun,
they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places 
they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet 
it's not the end of the world

But when they get home, 
damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgotten
