On the day I was born the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of every one
They said stop
I said go
They said fast
I said slow
They said yes
I said no
I do the bad boy boogie

Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women come along with me
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be
I said right
And they said left
I said east
And they said west
I said up
And they said down
I do the bad boy boogie
All over town

I wouldn't tell you no story
Tell you no lie
I was born to love till the day I die
I just line em up
And I knock em down
And they all came a runnin' when the word got around
Just keep runnin'
I said up
They said down
They said straight
I said round
They said lost
I said found
I said free
They said bound
Bad boy boogie
Do the bad boy
Bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie
