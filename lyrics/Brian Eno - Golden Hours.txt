The passage of time
Is flicking dimly up on the screen
I can't see the lines
I used to think I could read between
Perhaps my brains have turned to sand

Oh me oh my
I think it's been an eternity
You'd be surprised
At my degree of uncertainty
How can moments go so slow

Several times
I've seen the evening slide away
Watching the signs
Taking over from the fading day
Perhaps my brains are old and scrambled

Several times
I've seen the evening slide away
Watching the signs
Taking over from the fading day
Changing water into wine

Several times
I've seen the evening slide away
Watching the signs
Taking over from the fading day
Putting the grapes back on the vine

Who would believe what a poor set of eyes can show you
Who would believe what an innocent voice could do
Never a silence always a face at the door

Who would believe what a poor set of ears can tell you
Who would believe what a weak pair of hands can do
Never a silence always a foot in the door
