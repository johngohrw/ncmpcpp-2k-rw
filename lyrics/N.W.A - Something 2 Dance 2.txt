Yo give me somethin' to dance to

Calling the police, Calling the g-men
Calling all americans

Arabian Prince, back wit' a style that's hype
Not slow and low, it's the fast type
Gettin dumped, can you hear the drums
Yo Dre why don't you pump it up some
I pumped it up so now what's up
Yo Yella boy, add a little cut
What the hell, you think we need some bells
Yeah, homeboy, might as well
There it is, so now what's next
A little ssssssssssss
So find me a ho, wait a minute
You need somethin' else then
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove, bust a move
Yo I'm tired, what about you
Man this is somethin' to dance to

Man that's wack, everybody used that
Yo, why dont you bring back the other track
Yeah there you go that's what I'm sayin
I like it when that dope stuffs playin
Real loud, in ya ear hole
Man let's go, I think my feet are swoll' from dancin' so damn much
Maaaaaan, I don't give a what
You wanna leave? With all these females pullin on my sleeve
I bet, you can jet, homeboy, no sweat
This is what I want you to do
Feel the groove, bust a move
This is somethin' to dance to

Let the bass kick
Th-th-this is somethin ta dance to [x7]
