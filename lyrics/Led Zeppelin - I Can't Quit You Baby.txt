I can't quit you babe 
Woman I think I'm gonna put you down for a little while 
I can't quit you babe 
I... think I'm gonna put you down for a while 
I said you messed up my happy home 
Made me mistreat my only child 

You built my hopes so high 
Baby then you let me down so low 
You built my hopes so high then ya let me down... so low 
Don'tcha realize sweet baby? 
Woman I don't know... which way to go 

Woman I can't quit you babe 
I think I'm gonna put you down for a while
