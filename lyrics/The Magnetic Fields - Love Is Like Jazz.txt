Love Is Like JazzThe Magnetic FieldsLove is like jazzYou make it up as you go alongAnd you act asIf you really knew the songBut you don'tAnd you never willSo you flaunt your mistakesAnd you make them untilThey were youLove is like jazzThe same song a million timesIn different ways"Strange Fruit" withAnd without wind chimesIt's divineIt's asinineIt's depressingAnd it's almost entirelyWindow dressingBut it'll do[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Love_Is_Like_Jazz ]
