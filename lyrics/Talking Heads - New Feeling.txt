It's not...yesterday...anymore
I go visiting, I talk loud
I try to make myself clear
In front...of a face...that's nearer
Than it's ever been before
Not this close before
Nearer than before
Not this close before

It is...is a million...years ago
I hear music...and it sounds like bells
I feel like my head is high
I wish...I could meet...every one
Meet them all over again
Bring them up to my room
Meet them all over again
Everyone's up in my room

And now...Now I'm busy...Busy again
I feel like sitting down but
I'm still thinking...Thinking about my friends
In my garden...moments
But now I'm speaking out
Speaking about my friends
Now I'm speaking out
Thinking about my friends
