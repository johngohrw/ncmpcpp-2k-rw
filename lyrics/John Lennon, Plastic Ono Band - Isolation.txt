People say we got it made.
Don't they know we're so afraid?
Isolation.

We're afraid to be alone,
everybody got to have a home.
Isolation.

Just a boy and a little girl,
trying to change the whole wide world.
Isolation.

The world is just a little town,
everybody trying to put us down.
Isolation.

I don't expect you to understand,
after you've caused so much pain.
But then again, you're not to blame.
You're just a human, a victim of the insane.

We're afraid of everyone,
Afraid of the sun.
Isolation

The sun will never disappear,
but the world may not have many years.
Isolation.
