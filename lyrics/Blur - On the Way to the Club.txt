On my way to the club
I fell down a hole
All the people there
Said you come alone
And I, I just want to be, darling with you
The music's made that way
My eyes aren't blue
There's nothing I can do

So I stayed in the club
Just rewarding myself
Happiness could turn into something else
And I just wanna be, darling with you
The music's made that way
My eyes aren't blue, there's nothing I can do
