I got in a fight, I was indisposed
I was in despite all the wicked prose
But I'm only a man and I do what I can

I got friends in high places, I get out for free
I got in a fight but they don't know me
'Cause I'm only a man and I do what I can

B-E-H-A-V-E
Arrest us!
Tell me I'm a mobster looking so precious, uh
B-E-H-A-V-E
Never more
You gave up being good when you declared a state of war

Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, ooh-whoa-oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?

I did something bad, maybe I was wrong
Sometimes people say that I'm a big time bomb
But I'm only a man and I do what I can

B-E-H-A-V-E
Arrest us!
Tell me I'm a mobster looking so precious, uh
B-E-H-A-V-E

Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, ooh-whoa-oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?

Oh, whoa-oh-woo
The fire hurts so right
'Cause we can make 'em all a bit crazy
We can make 'em all right
Oh, whoa-oh-woo
The fire hurts so right
The people touch it
I can't touch it, even though it's mine

Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Eh, oh, don't behave, oh, don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, ooh-whoa-oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can (do what I can)
