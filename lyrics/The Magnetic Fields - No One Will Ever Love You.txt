No One Will Ever Love YouThe Magnetic FieldsIf you don't mind, why don't you mind?Where is your sense of indignationYou are too kind, much too kindWhere is the madness that you promised me?Where is the dream for which I paid dearly?When things go wrong I sing alongIt is the nature of the businessBut you're not here to make my sad songs more sincereNo one will ever love you honestlyNo one will ever love you for your honestyNo one will ever love you honestlyNo one will ever love you for your honesty[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:No_One_Will_Ever_Love_You ]
