Sunshine brings laughter,
Rainclouds brings me down.
I know forever after,
I need the light, keep me ground.
Whoa mama, I get so lonely.
In the rain, feel so blue
I want you to remember, I'm your one and only, woman.
Hey baby, hey baby, love you true!

Dream boy, on the river.
Oh blue skies, on my mind.
Ah the fields, seemed to glitter.
I know, I know, will bring you down!

Ah baby, I've got some thinking.
Whoa mama, strip my mind.
Hey baby, I took a drinking.
I know, I know come around!

In the light, in the light,

Oh girl, stop your crying.
Oh woman, dry your eyes.
Whoa tomorrow, the sun will be shining.
You won't remember all the tears you cried!

Hey baby, I think you wonder.
Hey baby, tears of joy.
Woman, tears of laughter.
Sweet ma, sweet ma, I'm coming home!
's all you got to do yeah!

With the light.
Everybody needs the light.

The light, 
's all you got to do now!

Light, light, light, in the light!
Light, light, light, in the light!
