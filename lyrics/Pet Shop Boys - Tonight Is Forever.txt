I may be wrong, I may be right
Money's short and time is tight
Don't even think about those bills
Don't pay the price, we never will
We're out again another night
I never have enough
It will be like this forever
If we fall in love

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key

I may be wrong, I may be right
So don't depend, I could lie
I haven't got a job to pay
But I could stay in bed all day
Then out again another night
I never have enough
It will be like this forever
If we fall in love

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight is the first night

We don't need any more when we dance
I don't think of the future tonight

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key

I may be wrong, I may be right
But I don't give up any night
You could say conventional
And I could claim intentional
We're out again another night
We never have enough
It will be like this forever
When we fall in love

Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key
Tonight is forever, tell me now you don't disagree
Tonight is forever, open the door, you hold the key

Tonight
