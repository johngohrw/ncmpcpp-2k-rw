Jubilee slouches in the settee
He losing all will to move
He gone divy too much telly
He watching 24 hours of rubbish
He got butane he got plastic bags
His eyes are going square oh yeah
He no raver just anti social
He no going to cut his hair

HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM SEVENTEEN, HE NOT MEAN
ENOUGH
HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM SEVENTEEN, NOT KEEN ON
BEING LIKE ANYONE ELSE

Jubilee's dad Billy Banker
He thinks his son is a slob
He should get out more stop scabbing
He really should go and get a job

HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM SEVENTEEN
HE NOT MEAN ENOUGH
HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM WHERE TO GO
BUT HE JUST DON'T GET OUT ENOUGH
HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM TALK TO GIRLS
BUT HE'S JUST TOO SPOTTY
HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM SEVENTEEN
HE NOT KEEN ON BEING LIKED BY ANYONE ELSE
SO HE JUST PLAYS ON HIS COMPUTER GAME

HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM SEVENTEEN
HE NOT MEAN ENOUGH
HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM WHERE TO GO
BUT HE JUST DON'T GET OUT ENOUGH

HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM TALK TO GIRLS
BUT HE'S JUST TOO SPOTTY
HE DRESSES INCORRECTLY... NO-ONE TOLD HIM SEVENTEEN
HE NOT KEEN ON BEING LIKED
ANYONE HE'S NOT BEING LIKE
