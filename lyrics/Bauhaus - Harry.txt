Well hello pretty woman 
You're looking good 
With a yellow dot skirt 
And you're swaying hah 

You look as though you've ate your one last meal 
You're conceit is all thats left 
You can sing a spiel 
You used to hide away in kiosk land 
Let's find you out and loosen up 
You're so upset 

Making coffee for the poor machines 
Stipulate, copulate for all his schemes 

I have you 
You have me 
We go where we want to be 
We have it 
We have fun 
We go places to have some hah 

Well they're as stiff as New York 
With the right wing lights 
And the babies get for real if the group is right 
Following her swallowing some two-tone pills 
They said he's looking crazy but he's so well built 
You're moving steady, soon you'll be that star 
Don't wrap up my tomorrows in your infectious car 
They'll line you up and strip you down you'll see 
That you're still the horny two-eyed bitch you used to be 

Harree aee ah 

Your mothers and your fathers and your boyfriend too 
They're hiding places can't and won't expect you to 

But he's seen shadows upon that ball 
Fix the cast or fix to catch the things they install 
They'll soon realize that stardom's going to your head 
They'll visualize you rising my poor blood is dead... 

Your mother father brother sister too 
Natural best 
All the best go on you 

I have you 
You have me 
We go where we want to be 
We have it 
We have fun 
We go places to have some 

(Harree aee ah)
