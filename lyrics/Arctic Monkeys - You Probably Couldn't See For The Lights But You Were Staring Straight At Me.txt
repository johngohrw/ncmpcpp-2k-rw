One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces

They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Well, my heart beats at its peak,
When you're coming up to speak

And oh I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer?
And I'm talking gibberish,
Tip of the tongue but I can't deliver it

...Properly, oh it's all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark you'd see how red my face has gone, yeah

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that to make you smile
Those that claim that they're not showing off are drowning in denial
But they're not half as bad as me say anything and I'll agree
'Cause when it comes to acting up, I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you're more than a part in the play
It's slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks, yeah

Never again, never again, oh, will there be another one quite as desirable as you

One look sends it coursing through the veins oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces
