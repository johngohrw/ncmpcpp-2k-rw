Dodo dodo dodo 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
But I ain't touched the sky 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
But I ain't touched the sky 

She's a girl in a dream 
She sees a four-eyed cartoon monster 
On the T.V. screen 
She takes another puff and says 
"It's a crazy scene" 
That red is green 
And she's a tangerine 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
But I ain't left the ground 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
I hope I never ever come down 

She's the girl in her life 
But her world's a superficial paradise 
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice 
But no dice 
She wasn't very nice 

Ooh 

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do dodo do dodo 
Do do do do do do 

Dodo do do do dodo 
Do do dodo do dodo 
Dodo dodo 
Dodo dodo 
Dodo dodo 

I'm too high 
I'm too high 
I'm so high 
I feel like I'm about to die 

I can't ever touch the sky 

I'm too high 
She's a girl of the past 
I guess that I got to her at last 
A did you hear the news about the girl today 
She passed away 
What did her friend say 

They said she's too high 
Too high 
Can't hang around anyway... 

Dodo do do do dodo
