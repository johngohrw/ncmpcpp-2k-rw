She was still sleeping; the problem will stay
One more day
Said she's not sorry the wind blows her way
Accidents happen, there's one planned today
Oh you see...

I wish it was not true
But that's the way it is
It's not your fault
That's the way it is
I'm sick of you
And that's the way it is
And will always be.

Wednesday is over, it's over again.
Said my goodbyes to the life we won't spend
Together...

I wish it was not true
But that's the way it is
It's not your fault
That's the way it is
I'm sick of you
And that's the way it is

But that's not your problem
That's not a problem
That's not my problem
That's not your problem.
