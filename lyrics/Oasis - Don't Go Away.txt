Cold and frosty morning - there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind.
And as the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind.

And I wanna be there when you're coming down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away,
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'cause I need more time,
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind.
Damn my education - I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind.

And I wanna be there when you're coming down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground

So don't go away,
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'cause I need more time,
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Me and you - what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong.

So don't go away,
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'cause I need more time,
Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

Yes, I need more time
Just to make things right

So don't go away.
