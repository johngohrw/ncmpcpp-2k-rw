Walking with you on a happy sunny dayyou know me clever more than retrieverWashing me everyday tidy neatyou know me a precious dog as a dynamiteBelieve in meIf it's rainy againNobody wanna cryNice cow bone you are my loverShall we promise everyday go to walk in the park?Shall we promise everyday go to walk without chain?You will forget, on cloudy day,so lovely and sweet pretty poodle, alone againNice cow bone you are my loverCollar may be feell a freeShall we promise everyday go to walk in the park?Shall we promise everyday go to walk without chain?You will forget, on cloudy day,so lovely and sweet pretty poodle, alone again
