If you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you 

I may not always love you
But as long as there are 
stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you
