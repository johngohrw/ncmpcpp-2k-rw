Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat too
Frenchy eat frog
And I eat you
Business man when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust
Do you sign your life away
Do you write your name in dust
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and downs below
And limbo's in between
Up you win
Down you lose
It's anybody's game
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie
That's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for somethin' free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
Hey, what's in it for me
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
