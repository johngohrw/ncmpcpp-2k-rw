All my life I was swinging for the fence,
I was looking for the triple,
Never playing good defence

Gunnin' for the glitter,
Every hot and heavy hitter,
She was never really there so I couldn't really get her

I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it

Piece of work, I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore, a busy mind can go berserk
Oh feast on this, I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip, and I opened up the book

I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, is just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?

[Chorus:]
Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...

Crack your whip, she's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there, but not as much for round-trip
Oh all this time, I was searching for a dream
I was slippin' in and out of every other sex machine

I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, is just a medicine
Makes you wanna cry, why don'd they let us in?

[Chorus:]
Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...

Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Faith
And love
And luh-ooh-uh-ooh-uh-ooh-uh-ooh-ove
