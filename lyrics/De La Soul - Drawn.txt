[Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon:]
Shadow you're drawn, why don't you go?
In the corner babe watching the snow
Moving afar, rolling away
In the corner, believe, why won't you stay?
Won't you stay babe? Won't you stay babe?

[Yukimi Nagano:]
Oh, I never know what come around, I never looked ahead
A r [?] 's pulling us down, the words I wished I'd said
Shadow you're drawn and you got your ways
Shadow you're painted red
Red
Moving afar, rolling away
In the corner, believe, why won't you stay?
Won't you stay babe? Won't you stay babe?

It's drawn

[Posdnuos:]
One, two
Yo, I'm with the paper plate, hold
Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Foot on the floor, not on the wasted [?]
Or what's being pasted and know that it's not a copy
I own a prize instead of gas price
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born in a generation that don't generate patience
I travel too fast for you to clock me (time)
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour
I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones
Had me like a fiend screamin' "What you got for me?"
Two words (I'm mortal)
But the fans lift 'em both together and remove the apostrophe
Hip hop's lords maybe but my ways needs laundering
Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!
