Washington, D.C.The Magnetic FieldsW a-s-h i-n-g t-o-n, baby, D.C.!W a-s-h i-n-g t-o-n, baby, D.C.!Washington, D.C.It's paradise to meIt's not because it is the grand old seatOf precious freedom and democracyNo, no, noIt's not the greenery turning gold in fallThe scenery circling the MallIt's just that's where my baby livesThat's allWashington D.C.!It's the greatest place to beIt's not the cherries everywhere in bloomIt's not the way they put folks on the moonNo, no, noIt's not the spectacles and pagaentryThe thousand things you've got to seeIt's just that's where my baby waits for meW a-s-h i-n-g t-o-n, baby D.C.!W a-s-h i-n-g t-o-n, baby D.C.!Washington, D.C.!It fits me to a TIt's not the people doing something realIt's not the way the springtime makes you feelNo, no, noIt ain't no famous name on a golden plaqueThat keeps me that makes me ride that railroad trackIt's my baby's kiss that keeps me coming backIt's my baby's kiss that keeps me coming back[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Washington%2C_D.C. ]
