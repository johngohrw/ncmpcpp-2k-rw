Daddy was dumb said that Iâ€™d be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up was gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat but I look fantastic

Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe

I'm waking up, lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sipping codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe

Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
Come back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Come back down to my knees
Be like them, lean back and breathe
