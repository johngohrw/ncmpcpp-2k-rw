All the people had their share of the glory
looking out after you
It's just a story about winners and glory
and you know that it's true

Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star

And it's my ambition, of a jacket ignition
in a Cadillac metal car

Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star

You're just a shooting star
