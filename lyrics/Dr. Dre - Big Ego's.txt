[Dr. Dre]
I got mo' class than most of em, ran wit the best of em
Forgave the less of em, and blazed at the rest of em
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately 
and the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.
started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin, pistol holdin
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder, for real
I'm hittin switches, makin bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases 

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggaz play this in they Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in they Benzes Jeeps and Geos
[repeat 2X]

[Hitman]
I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin hoes at movies
Passin by with uzis - and who you aimin at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin that
Rat-ta-tat-tat [automatic gunfire and screaming]
[more screaming as tires peel out]
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
tryin to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
like snitch niggaz in the pen that get
hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit crews
that's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me wit no other by the flow motherfucker 

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 - Niggaz play this in they Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 - Bitches play this in they Benzes Jeeps and Geos
