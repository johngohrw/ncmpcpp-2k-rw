Everybody in the morning
Should do a good turn all right
Everybody in the night time
Should have a good time all night
Now we got a movement
Don't shun it fun it
Can't you see now you're moving free?
Get some fun join our dynasty
Can't you tell when we get it down?

Hey everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight

Do your thing do your thing your wa
Get you kicks get your tricks with me
Get up and dance honey fun's for free

Hey everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody everybody gonna have a good time tonight
That's the only sole you'll ever meet

Don't shun it fun it
