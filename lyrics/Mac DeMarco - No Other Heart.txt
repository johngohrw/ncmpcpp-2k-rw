Is it true?
You've been feeling sort of low these days
Just don't have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

If it's so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

Is it wrong? To think my love could really help you out
It's simply just my stubborn heart no doubt, rambling away
If it's not

Then come on give this lover boy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
