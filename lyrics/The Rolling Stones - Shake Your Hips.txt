I wanna tell you 'bout a dance
That's goin' around,
Everybody's doin' it
From the grownups down.
Don't move your head,
Don't move your hands,
Don't move your lips,
Just shake your hips.
Do the hip shake, babe,
Do the hip shake, babe,
Shake your hip, babe,
Shake your hip, babe.
What you don't know
Don't be afraid
Just listen to me
And do what I say.
Don't move your head,
Don't move your hands,
Don't move your lips,
Just shake your hips.
Do the hip shake, babe,
Do the hip shake, babe,
Shake your hip, babe,
Shake your hip, babe,
Well ain't that easy
Well, I met a little girl
In a country town
She said, "What do you know
There's Slim Harpo!"
Didn't move her head,
Didn't move her hands,
Didn't move her lips,
Just shook her hips.
Do the hip shake, babe,
Do the hip shake, babe,
Shake your hip, babe,
Shake your hip, babe,
Well ain't that easy.
