You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room, 
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do
What in the world can you do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait 
until the crowd goes
Oh, wait 
until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

So deep in your room, 
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do
What in the world can I do
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

Oh, what you gonna say?
Oh, what you gonna do?
Ah, what you gonna be?
To the real me 
to the real me

Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh [repeat ad inf.]
