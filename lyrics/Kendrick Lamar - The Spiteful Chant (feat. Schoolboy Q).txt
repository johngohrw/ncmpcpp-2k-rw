[Hook:]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I do is alumni
I'm a take my time, I'm a master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up
I seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign
Till I resign on your report
That I done you wrong, and I mean to know
My homie never
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever
But however...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit
If he gave me a handout
I'm a take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo
Chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix
As them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad
HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash
Old friends I no longer have

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q (Kendrick Lamar)]
I remember when I came out and shit
Man it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
God dammit K Dot when it comes to this
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch
Nigga I was motherfucking outchea
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should've been making bangers
I was somewhere stuck with a flame here
Motherfucker see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year
Can I get a hell yea?
Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride
(Music saved my fucking life
I'm doing right
And you left behind
Feel my pain, now I'm styling
Heard this shit, I spent a thousand
Different homes, different islands)
Dropped my mix-tape and it sold like an album
Reason why I'm...

Going big, bitch suck my dick
Yea I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Tell em I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Yea I'm going big, bitch suck my dick

[Hook 2x]
