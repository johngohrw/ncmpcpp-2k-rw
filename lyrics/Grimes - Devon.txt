Oh my love I know
It's hurting
Asking me
And I know I'm holding onto dust
When my heart is telling me
In my head we can
Take my hand
If you can
I can be your bride
You'd be my man
But you don't love me anymore
Dadadadadadadada

Oh my love
Are we
I'm here without you again
I keep waiting
On you
When you love her
And I love you
Oh my love
I know
That you are hurting me and
And I'm know
I'm holding onto dust
My heart is telling me
You're kind
In my head yeah
I can hear you
Too you'd be my man
You don't love me anymore
Getting dark
I have waited before
Long night
I will wait before
