Weaving down a byroad,
singing the song
That's my kind of highroad, 
gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no
to the Beauty and the Beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?
My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no 
to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
You can't say no
to the Beauty and the Beast 
(Weakling)
My-my
You can't say no 
to the Beauty and the Beast

I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should

My-my

Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank god heaven left us
Standing on our feet
My-my
Beauty and the Beast

My-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no
to the Beauty and the Beast
Darling

My-my
My
My-my
My
