i believe jehovah jireh
i believe there's heaven 
i believe in war 
i believe a woman's temple 
gives her the right to choose
but baby don't abort
i believe that marriage isn't 
between a man & woman 
but between love and love 
and i believe you when you say that 
you've lost all faith 
but you must believe in something 
something something 
you gotta believe in something 
something something 

i still believe in man 
a wise one asked me why
cause i just don't believe we're wicked 
i know that we sin but i do believe we try 
we all try 
the girls try 
the boys try 
women try 
men try 
you and i 
try try we all try 

i don't believe in time travel 
i don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon 
i don't believe our lives are simple 
and i don't believe they're short 
this is interlude 
i don't believe my hands are cleanly 
can't believe that you would 
let me touch your heart 
she didn't believe me when i said that 
i lost my faith 
said you must believe in something
something  something 
you gottta believe in something 
something something

i still believe in man 
a wise one asked me why
cause i just don't believe we're wicked 
i know that we sin but i do believe we try 
we all try 
the girls try 
the boys try  
women try 
men try 
you and i 
try try we all try
