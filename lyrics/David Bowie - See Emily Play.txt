Emily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til 
tomorrow

[CHORUS]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

[CHORUS]

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily

[CHORUS]
