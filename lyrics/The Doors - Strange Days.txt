Strange days have found us 
Strange days have tracked us down 
They're going to destroy 
Our casual joys 
We shall go on playing 
Or find a new town 

Yeah! 

Strange eyes fill strange rooms 
Voices will signal their tired end 
The hostess is grinning 
Her guests sleep from sinning 
Hear me talk of sin 
And you know this is it 

Yeah! 

Strange days have found us 
And through their strange hours 
We linger alone 
Bodies confused 
Memories misused 
As we run from the day 
To a strange night of stone
