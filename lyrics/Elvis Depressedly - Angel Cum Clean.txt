angel cum clean you are not what you seem
i was taking xanax listening to morphine
i pulled over the car right before i went dark
i threw us up in the street

i know you know what i mean
i know you angel cum clean

angel cum clean you are know what you seem
i was taking xanax listening to codeine 
as i was missing your call i set all my dreams my free
something's been wearing me down 

i know you know what i mean
i know you angel cum clean
