I love women, I think they're great
they're a solace to the world in a terrible state
They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to soul
what a nightmare to have no women in the world

I love women
I love women
I love women
we all love women

I used to look at women in the magazines
I know that it was sexist, but I was in my teens
I was very bitter, all my sex was on the sly
I couldn't keep my hands off women, and I won't till I die

I love women
ah, I love women
we love women
we all love women

A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire
I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir
A choir of castratis to serenade my love
they'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love

I love women
I love women
We all love women
we love women
