Way back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some - I bought some . . .
Oh Oh Oh
After a while
when I had tried them
denied them
I opened my eyes and
I saw you . . .

Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
'Till I called on your love
And your love came to me

OH OH OH OH OH OH

Through my life
I've seen gray sky,
met big fry,
seen them die to get high . . .
Oh Oh Oh
And when it seemed that I would
always be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you

Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
'Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow

OH OH OH OH OH OH

Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some

Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
