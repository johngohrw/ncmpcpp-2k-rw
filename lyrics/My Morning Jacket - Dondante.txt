In a dream, I saw you walkin'
Like a kid alive and talkin', that was you
In the classroom, you were teachin'
On the streets you were policin' that was you

To the one I now know most
I will tell them of your ghost like a thing that never, ever was

And all that ever mattered
Will some day turn back to batter like a joke
Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings
Takes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thing

In a dream I saw you walkin'
With your friends alive and talkin', that was you
Well I saw it in your movements
And even though you never knew it, well I knew

Just how sweet it could be
If you'd never left these streets

You had me worried, so worried that this would last
You had me worried, so worried that this would last
But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass
But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass
