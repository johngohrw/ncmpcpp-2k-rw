You think I'm magical
You talk a fancy talk
Something intangible
In the way I walk
You've got no common sense
Boy I've heard them all
Throwing your compliments
Up against the wall

You get me a tick or two
I already bought them
You ain't make my dreams come true
I've already got them
Words are blurry when you speak
Boy I thought I told you
Now you're tripping over me
I'm not here to hold you

You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me

It's all so typical
Way you call my name
Nothing subliminal
In how you play your game
See I don't miss a thing
You're so crystal clear
I've seen you whispering
In every other ear

You said you have seen the world
I don't really buy it
You say I'm the perfect girl
Don't you even try it
Words are blurry when you speak
Boy I thought I told you
Now you're tripping over me
I'm not here to hold you

You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me

So inflated, so inflated
Crush your fist again now
I can't take it
When you are so wasted

You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
You're wasted, you're wasted on me
