Where do we go?
And all the people, they sure don't want you to know
They don't want you to know, oh
Livin' in chains, the heart's rearranged
You gotta lure it back, all of the time
Now tell me I'm right, oh

[Pre-Chorus:]
And I got a thing I really can't say

[Chorus:]
You've got a worried mind
I've got a worried heart
You don't know what to do
I don't know where to start
You let this beat us down
Well get up off the ground
One day, I know
We've got to go, oh

Where is your mind?
The street is beating you bad
It's taken it's time, it's taken it's time, oh
Oh, where to run?
I told you to get, but you were having your fun
Now you're under the gun, oh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
