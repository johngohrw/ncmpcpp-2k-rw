[Hook:]
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it man
Let's just not even discuss it, man, O-M-G
Niggas sleep, I ain't trippin' I'ma let em sleep
I ain't trippin' let em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell these story I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was paying mamma's rent when I was turning 17
Sold it dirty like Diana never clean
My ex ask me, "Where you moving?" I said, "On to better things."

[Hook]

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

[Hook]

I been on a mission haven't left the condo
This that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds
Treating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds
Take a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace
6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
(Woo)
They got me feeling like the one again
Yeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

[Hook]

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit going
In the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri
