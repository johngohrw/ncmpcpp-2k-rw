I can't see your face in my mind 
I can't see your face in my mind 
Carnival dogs 
Consume the lines 
Can't see your face in my mind 

Don't you cry 
Baby, please don't cry 
And don't look at me 
With your eyes 

I can't seem to find the right lie 
I can't seem to find the right lie 
Insanity's horse 
Adorns the sky 
Can't seem to find the right lie 

Carnival dogs 
Consume the lines 
Can't see your face in my mind 

Don't you cry 
Baby, please don't cry 
I won't need your picture 
Until we say goodbye
