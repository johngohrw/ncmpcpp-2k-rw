Take your time, hear em out
How they went to go about to give it up and find yourself in time
Take your time, it’s all about
The circle up to circle out what’s in your mind, then take yr time

Take your time, come about
Draw your flag and hand it out, then take a look and then hide it deep inside
Take your time, hear em out
It works if you work it out, to clean out your mind, and take yr time
