To the extent that I wear skirts
And cheap nylon slips
I've gone native
I wanted to know the exact dimension of hell
Does this sound simple?
Fuck you! Are you for sale?
Does 'Fuck you' sound simple enough?
This was the only part that turned me on
But he was candy all over

Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more

I grew up in a shotgun row
Sliding down the hill
Out front were the big machines
Steel and rusty now I guess
Outback was the river
And that big sign down the road
That's where it all started

Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
Come on down to the store
You can buy some more, and more, and more, and more
You can buy some more, more, more, more
