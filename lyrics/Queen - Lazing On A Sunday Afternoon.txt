I go out to work on a Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for Sunny-down,
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy,
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
lazing on a Sunday
lazing on a Sunday Afternoon.
