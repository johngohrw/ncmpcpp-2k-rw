Is this, climbin' up to the moon?
Or is it bailin' out too soon?
I hope we didn't, I hope we didn't wait too long
I hope we didn't, I hope we didn't wait too long

All that I wanted to say
Words only got in the way
But then I found another way to communicate
Oh, yeah, oh

Is this, climbin' up to the moon?
Or is it fadin' out too soon?
Oh I know we didn't, I know we didn't wait too long
'Cause anytime's a good time to move on

Things I could say to myself
I could never say to anyone else
But what Madonna said, really helped
She said, "Boy, you better learn to express yourself"

I know we didn't, I know we didn't wait too long
'Cause anytime's a good time to move on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh
