I got more than I asked for,
there ain't nothin' I need.
I took all till I had more,
I'm always takin' the lead.

Old man shakin' dice down on the street,
try'n to make a livin' somehow
but I'm really sure about gettin' things sorted out
and I'm gettin' ready right now.

You can't hold me,
I have told you.
Might just take your life,
might just take your life.

I've been called by many names
and all of them are bad.
I can take it all the same,
it's all I've ever had.

I've got somethin' that you can't get
but one thing you can see:
gettin' there ain't easy
but it sure was hard for me.

You can't hold me,
I have told you.
Might just take your life,
might just take your life.

Every time I take a look
there's someone close behind.
They never used to make a pass,
the things that crossed their minds.

Now they tell me that it's all right
and they want to be my friend.
They're ridin' on my back.
When is it goin' to end?

You can't hold me,
I have told you.
Might just take your life,
might just take your life,
might just take your life.

Got more than I asked for,
got more than I need.
Got more than I asked for,
got more than I need.
Got more than I asked for,
got more than I need.
