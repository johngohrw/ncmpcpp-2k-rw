The wavelength gently grows
Coercive notions re-evolve
A universe is trapped inside a tear
It resonates the core
Creates unnatural laws
Replaces love and happiness with fear

Oooo

How much deception can you take
How many lies will you create
How much longer until you break
Your mind's about to fall

And they're breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
We are losing control

They're breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
Now we're falling
We are losing control

Invisible to all
The mind becomes a wall
All of history deleted with one stroke

Oooo

How much deception can you take
How many lies will you create
How much longer until you break
Your mind's about to fall

And they're breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
Now we're falling
We are losing control
