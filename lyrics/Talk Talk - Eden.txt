Summer bled of Eden
Easter's heir uncrowns
Another destiny 
lies leeched 
upon the ground

Everybody needs someone to live by
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs someone to live by

Rage on omnipotent

A gilded wreath on reason
The flower crushed conceives
A child of fragrance 
so much clearer
In legacy

Everybody needs someone to live by
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs someone to live by

Rage on omnipotent
