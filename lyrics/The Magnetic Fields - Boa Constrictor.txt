Boa ConstrictorThe Magnetic FieldsI spend my evenings aloneTalking to your picture, babeLove is wrapped around my heartLike a boa constrictor, babeMy mother should have murdered me What jury would convict her, babe?For love is wrapped around my heartLike a boa constrictor, babe[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Boa_Constrictor ]
