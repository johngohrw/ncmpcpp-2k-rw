What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down.
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.
I'm going up, and I'm going down.
I'm going from side to side.
See the bells, up in the sky,
Somebody's cut their string in two.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.
One minute born, one minute doomed,
One minute up, one minute down.
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.
