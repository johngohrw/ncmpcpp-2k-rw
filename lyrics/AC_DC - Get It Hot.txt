Goin' out on the town
Just a me and you
Gonna have ourselves a party
Just like we used to do
Nobody's, playin' Manilow
Nobody's, playin' soul
And no one's playin' hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

Movin' down the motorway
Got a whole lotta booze
Got myself a sweet little number
Who's got nothin' to lose
I'm gonna bend you like a g string
Conduct you like a choir
So get your body in the right place
We'll set the world on fire
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
You can get it
Get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Make me feel good
Get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Whoa yeah
