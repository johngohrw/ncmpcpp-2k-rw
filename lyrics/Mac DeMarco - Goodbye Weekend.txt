Goodbye weekend, so long darling
Macky's been a bad bad boy
And when their preaching is sure to change me
Should rearrange me or so they thought

So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life
Sometimes rough, but generally speaking I'm fine
If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life,
Well honey that's fine just know that you're wasting your time

Sort me, place me, give me a sign
Repeat the mantra when you're stepping out of line
Give me a number, something to be
May help out the country boy but it won't work out on me

[x2:]
So don't go telling me how this boy should be leading his own life

If you don't agree with the things that go on within in my life
