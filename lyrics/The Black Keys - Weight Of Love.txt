I used to think, darlin', you never did nothin'
But you were always up to somethin'
Always had a run in, yeah
I got to think those days are comin' to get ya
Now no body want to protect yah
They only want to forget yah

[Chorus:]
You'll be on my mind
Don't give yourself away
To the weight of love
You'll be on your side
Don't give yourself away
The weight of, weight of love

Dance all night cause people, they don't wanna be lonely
Never wanna be lonely
They don't wanna be an only - one
You had a thing no one could ever be sure of
Never ever had a pure love
And never no cure from

[Chorus]
