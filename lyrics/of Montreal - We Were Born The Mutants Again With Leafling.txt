She says I'm boring her camera
It takes more to delight the cadaver
Night eyes on icy patrol
Yours were not so Nazi feline
Mine were as dead as monks
And our particles are in motion

Night eyes producing ashes
We love to view unfortunate passions
Still, she takes my photo to bed
No mere limp verse could incite identity destruction
Our particles are in motion

Sometimes we're not legible
But we're the same strange animal
Let them say our love is peculiar; Don't care

There's only now, no ever after
We won't let this end in disaster
You are my twin
No, I will never go there
