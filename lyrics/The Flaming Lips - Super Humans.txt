Once in a while, the time will come
To surrender everything you have to give
Once in a while, the time will come
To surrender everything you have to give

I would have given up for you
I know they're gonna bump and collide
I'm sure there's planets wrapped up with you
I've seen them kissing out in the hallway

Once in a while, the zebras run
To the spaceman and his gun, in the spider's web
Once in a while, the zebras run
To the spaceman and his gun, in the spider's web

I would have given up for you
I know they're gonna bump and collide
I'm sure there's plannets wrapped up with you
I've seen them kissing out in the hallway
