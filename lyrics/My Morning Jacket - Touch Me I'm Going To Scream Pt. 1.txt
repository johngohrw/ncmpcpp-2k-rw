Touch me I'm going to scream if you don't
Inside I know we have the feeling that you won't, oh
I know it sounds confusing, but it makes a lot of sense
Row a boat across the ocean, dig a hole under the fence

Touch me I'm going to scream if you don't
Inside I know we have the feeling that you won't, oh
I can tell by the way you smile, I'm smiling too
I see myself in you
I can tell by the sounds you make when you are pleased
You see yourself in me

Touch me I'm going to scream if you don't
Inside I know we have the feeling that you won't
How many nights can a soul so full of life remain untouched
How can a soul make the most of what is whole and what is here, oh

I need a human right by my side, untied, untied
I need a human right by my side, untied, untied
I need a human right by my side, untied, untied
