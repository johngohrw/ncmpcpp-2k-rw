These bitches want Nikes (This is a setup)
They looking for a check (Oh my god)
Tell em it ain't likely (This bitch tryna set me up)
Said she need a ring like Carmelo (Hands up, oh my god)
Must be on that white like Othello (Oh my, it's a real life angel)
All you want is Nikes (Yeah)
But the real ones just like you (Tell these niggas)
Just like me (Tell these guys you ain't basic)

I don't play, I don't make time
(Tell these guys you wear Zanottis, you a hottie, this is heaven on earth)
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
(But if you're in the party don't bring your shotty
Love everybody)
Pour up for A$AP (rest in peace)
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)
RIP Trayvon, a nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
(Remember one thing, remember one thing: don't take no photos in the party)
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
(That's rule number one
Rule number two: don't take no photos in the party)
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
(Rule number three: I got one left)
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
(If you in the-)
Punk madre, punk papa
(If you couldn't get to the-, go your ass to sleep, we in the-)
He don't care for me
(Special shoutout to them live niggas at Rap-A-Lot records)
But who cares for me
(We keep it hot)
And that's good enough
(I've been working on my bod, I feel hot)
We don't talk much or nothin'
(If we in the- holla at ya gwalla)
But when we talkin' about something
(Oh my god, hold up)
We have good discussion
(Tell these basic bitches we don't wear Nike)
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
(You guys are naughty, you a hottie, hold up)
That's good for us

We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
The only human in this humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
