This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In dissaray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go
We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In dissaray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved

My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life, my life has been saved
