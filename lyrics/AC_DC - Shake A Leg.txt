Idle juvenile on the street on the street
Kickin' everything with his feet with his feet
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law of the law
Don't kick don't fight don't sleep at night
And shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake a leg
Shake it again

Keepin' outta trouble with eyes in the back of my face
Kickin' ass in the class and they tell me I'm a damn disgrace
They tell me what they think but they stink and I really don't care
Got a mind of my own move on get outta my hair
Shake a leg shake your head
Shake a leg wake the dead
Shake a leg get stuck in
Shake a leg shake a leg

Magazines wet dreams dirty women on machine's for me
Big licks skin flicks tricky dick's are my chemistry
Goin' against the grain tryin to keep me sane with you
So stop your grinnin' and drop your linen for me
Shake a leg shake your head
Shake a leg wake the dead
Shake a leg get stuck in
Shake a leg shake a leg
Shake it

Idle juvenile on the street on the street
Kickin' everything with his feet with his feet
Fightin' on the wrong side of the law of the law
Spittin' and bitin' and kickin' and fightin' for more
Shake a leg shake your head
Shake a leg wake the dead
Shake a leg get stuck in
Shake a leg play to win
Shake a leg shake your head
Shake a leg wake the dead
Shake a leg get stuck in
Shake a leg
Shake a leg

Shake it
