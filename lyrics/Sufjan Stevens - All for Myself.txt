To bare it down to be in flight, to bare it down to be in flight 
It wasn't about me it was only a stone in my shoe 
Then worries came to perch on us 
Impatience and a painted bust
I kept you close to me close to my ear 

We set out once with folded shirts, with hairy chest and well rehearsed 
I want it all, I want it all for myself 
I'll set it right between your eyes 
Your shoulder blades, your running knife 
I want it all, I want it all for myself

Improving all the time, I am 
Improving as I kiss the hem 
I promise I won't be a trouble at all
For I'm okay, I'm in the red 
Impressions of the unmade bed 
You cradled close to me, close to my ear

We set out once forget our shirts with hairy chests and well rehearsed 
I want it all I want it all for myself
Out in the earth I smell of you 
Of bathing boy, amazing you 
I want it all, I want it all for myself
