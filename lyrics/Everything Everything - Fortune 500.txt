I'm at the gates, I'm climbing over the wall
To trip on the Queen and burn it down to the hall
The trail of destruction, but at least it's a trail
I am prepared to take you by the throat

They sing in my ears and make me feel like I'm lost
I don't want this, I've never spoken in love
Think of the people that I'm doing it for
I know the ways that I have been a slave
I've done the things that I was here to do
My twin, my twin, my dragon twin goes on

So ring the alarm, I'm in the palace garage
Fortune 500 like the bug in my eye
I know I'm only living the life, but still
That I should do this for my sons

So is this still on or should I take on the king?
The bee in me eye is just an animal sting
Then [?] so I can float in the wings
They speak in ways I do understand
They know I've come to answer their demands

I won, I won
They told me that I've won [x8]

Fortune 500 like the bug in my eye
Fortune 500 like whatever you ask

I know the ways that I have been a slave
I've done the things that I was here to do
I am prepared to take you by the throat
They speak in ways I do not understand
I won, I won, they told me that I've won
