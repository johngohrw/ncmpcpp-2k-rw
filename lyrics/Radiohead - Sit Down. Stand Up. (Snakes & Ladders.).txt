Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up 
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up) 
Anytime (sit down) 
Anytime (stand up)
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up
We can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime
Stand up (the rain drops the rain drops)
Sit down (the rain drops the rain drops)
Oh
The rain drops [x46]
