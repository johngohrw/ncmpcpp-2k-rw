She's only 18
Don't like the Rolling Stones
She took a short cut
To being fully grown

She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose

This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said my man you know
It's time to get your fingers wet
Your hustle's busted when
You can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "handle it"

Knock the world right off it's feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed

I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend

It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm gunna make you mine

It's understood you wrap
Your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your
Kitty at the discotheque
I put my lovin' in your oven
Not a head to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "resurrect"

Knock the world right off it's feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed

Knock the world right off it's feet
And straight onto its head
The book of love will
Long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play for all the
Brightest minds and light will shed
