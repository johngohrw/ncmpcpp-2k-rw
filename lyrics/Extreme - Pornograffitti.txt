Sex!

Sex on the brain
Pumped in my veins
Flowing from my head to my feet
Sex on TV
Rotation heavy
You and I are what we eat
Sex when I'm all alone
It calls me on the phone
Can't stop this ringing in my ear
Sex in excess
Filling all our senses
Keep saying there's nothing to fear

Can't you read the writing on the wall
Can't you seee the rising and the fall

All I see is pornograffitti
All I hear pornograffitti
See no, hear no
All I speak pornograffitti
All I fear pornograffitti
Speak no evil

Sex in 3D
No evil eyes see
Too much of it and you'll go blind
Sex education
Misinformation
Kiss me where the sun don't shine
Sex it surrounds me
Pornograffiti
It's all so constitutional
Sex is literate
Read all about it
But censor where you all can go

Can't you read the writing on the wall
Can't you see the rising and the fall

All I see is pornograffitti
All I hear pornograffitti
See no, hear no
All I speak pornograffitti
All I fear pornograffitti
Speak no evil

Sex sells
