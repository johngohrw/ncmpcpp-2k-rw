I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart.

This is a tricky situation -
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone -

You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart.

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts -
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love -

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone -

How it hurts - deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
Waiting for love.

Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love -
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way -

It's a long hard fight -
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love.
