Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, I can feel my instincts here for you, hey now
By my bed for you, hey now, hey now

Uhu, you know it is frightening
Uhu, uhu, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now,

Hey now, letters burning by my bed for you
Hey now, leave it to the wayside like you do, for you
Imagination calling mirrors for you
Hey now, hey now

Uh, you know it is frightening
Uhu, uhu, you know it’s like lightning
Hey now, now, hey now, now
Hey now, now,
Uhu, uhu, uhu, uhu
