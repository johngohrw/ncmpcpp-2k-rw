Intuition said it was fair
Only you should know by now there's
Not enough to go around

Here they come again
I can watch
As they try, they try to take it out
Here they come again, I can
Watch closer now
I can watch closer now

They can't find enough
To take enough from me
They can't find enough
To take enough from me

I've seen the hordes, the hordes
I've seen the hordes, the hordes
Looking down that drain of yours

Cartoon blue jay
Cartoon black bay, too

Cartoon blue jay
Cartoon black bay, too

Intuition knocked again
Fair
Only you should know by now there's
Not enough to go around

But I never go that way
Other half of me says I should

Other half of me says I should
Other half of me says I should
