I'm taking all you down with me
Explosives duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind

I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothing left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
Loneliness still comforts me

My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you
And the shit you put me through

Well no one here is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing

Do you ever think back to another time?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction
And mow down any bullshit that confronts you?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head?
To make one problem that adds up to nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
To me it's nothing
