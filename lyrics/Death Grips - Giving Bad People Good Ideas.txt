[Intro - Clementine Creevy:]
I keep, I keep
Good ideas
I keep, I keep giving bad
Giving bad people...

[Chorus - Clementine Creevy:]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Verse 1 - Ride:]
Those who can’t adjust
Ten fold dismantled pus
Operandi minus modus
My phlegm you to dust
Dragon chaser
I’ll quit later
Asteroid to midnight powder
This like genocide just louder
Fuck who we going after
Fuck them, I’m a have to fuck them over
And the closer, shows over
Bet bitch much, you wanna bet, bitch?
Keep that o and x shit
Feed a narc my driveway
Don’t trip ‘cause I may

[Chorus - Clementine Creevy:]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Verse 2 - Ride]
I cough up locks, catatonic jingle
Mausoleum treatment, strands of chemo
Unwell out my slit gashes tempo
I’m crawling with swarming crescendo
Execution, my nerves I’m slurring
You deserve this, your worthless disturbs me

[Bridge - Clementine Creevy:]
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind

[Verse 3 - Ride:]
Mutter, stagger, I’m in you
I got you covered, scatter, you’re meant to
Pull a lick real quick
Made off I fling
Shallow plots for senile kings
Cruelty keeps me even
I moan like flukes
Euphoria follows puke
I won’t pull my chute

[Chorus - Clementine Creevy:]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Verse 4 - Ride:]
Lead heavy lead us, remedy us
Hem me, I suffer to catch reflux
I ingest reflux
Bile threshold, cortex deluxe
Torture me lust
Holding horses with bacteria, uhh
I’m downing this vial of old Siberia
Overtoning mysteria

[Bridge - Clementine Creevy:]
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind
I want you to next time
It doesn’t sound so bad when I say it in my mind

[Chorus - Clementine Creevy:]
Giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas
I keep giving bad people good ideas

[Outro - Clementine Creevy:]
Good ideas
