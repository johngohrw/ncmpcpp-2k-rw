I'm closer to the Golden Dawn 
Immersed in Crowley's uniform 
Of imagery 
I'm living in a silent film 
Portraying 
Himmler's sacred realm 
Of dream reality 
I'm frightened by the total goal 
Drawing to the ragged hole 
And I ain't got the power anymore 
No I ain't got the power anymore 

I'm the twisted name 
on Garbo's eyes 
Living proof of 
Churchill's lies 
I'm destiny 
I'm torn between the light and dark 
Where others see their targets 
Divine symmetry 
Should I kiss the viper's fang 
Or herald loud
the death of Man 
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore

[CHORUS]
Don't believe in yourself 
Don't deceive with belief 
Knowledge comes
with death's release 

I'm not a prophet 
or a stone age man 
Just a mortal 
with the potential of a superman 
I'm living on 
I'm tethered to the logic 
of Homo Sapien 
Can't take my eyes 
from the great salvation 
Of bullshit faith 
If I don't explain what you ought to know 
You can tell me all about it 
On, the next Bardot
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore

[CHORUS]
