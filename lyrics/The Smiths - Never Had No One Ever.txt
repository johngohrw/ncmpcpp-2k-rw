When you walk without ease
On these streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days

And I know that, I know that
I never had no one ever

Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude

I know I'm alone
I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone

And I never, never had no one ever
I never had no one ever
