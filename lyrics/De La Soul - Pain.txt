Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world
Had you licked
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Didn't help on the sand you wander quick
Big mama said "the Devil's up to no good"
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book
Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu
Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light saying

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I heard the people say)
Pain will make it better
(I heard my people say)
Pain will make it better

[Snoop Dogg:]
No wetter, four-letter, mo' better
Slow pain, no gain, go getta
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather
But well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that pain makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation, but not for me G
I'm into public relations
That's food for you, De La Soul, word to the letter...

Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

The bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus
Talking wast to mobile, now we're on a house on a hill
Stronger, while filling ya gas tank
The bank was feeling your loan
The OT coudn't cover the bills
When life came with a couple of spills
But we're gonna use that pain fo' fuel so...

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
(I heard the people say)
Pain will make it better
(You and my people saying)
Pain will make it better
(I heard the people say)
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
