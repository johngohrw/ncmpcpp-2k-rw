My eyes are weary of you before me
I see for their sake, the light of daybreak
It shines upon me, this day we'd all see
No reason ever was given
No reason ever was given
 
Two ides of recoil, this moment's glory
A failed reminder of a broken story
My vague emotions one day will find
No reason ever was given
No reason ever was given
