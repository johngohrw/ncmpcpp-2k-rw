[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 1]
Now everybody serenade the new fate of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it
My point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics woulda told you Kendrick got killed and pretend its a massacre
And the masses upon us
And I master being the the master at dodging your honour
And the chapter that read at 25, I will live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then raid your spot while Kendrick’s performing
And if they take everything know I got…

Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

(Hey Dre whats happening with it my nigga)

[Dr Dre - Verse 2]
Still I’m at it, peel the plastic off it
You could feel the magic
Still I’m laughing at the critics talking
I can see ‘em gagging when I’m back in the back of my city
Back in the back with a batch, I’m banging Dre Beats with me
Look where I’m at, it’s the murder cap’
And I’m captain at birth of this gangsta rap
It’s a wrap when I’m done
And I’ve come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mill in a day
Bitch I’m from..

Compton, Compton

[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 3]
So come and visit, the tires screeching
Ambulance, policeman
Won’t you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki crease and crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where your sword at?
Hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big, it’s Rasputia for you shooters
Kama sutra screaming fuck your position and make you hold that
I’m trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know Flex and piru crip tatts

They swarm on me like a beehive hoop in the G ride
From the west to the east side
Know just how Compton roll

[Dr Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
And that’s a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch
Of course it’s my decision
I crashed the ports that you report
That you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import them narcotics

You bought it then talked about it when crack hit the speakers
The music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record depending on what you expected
I’m sure it’s bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

[Hook]
Compton, compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Dr Dre]
So tell that gangsta throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I’mma take you on that next high
I did exactly what I wanted, that’s what made them checks fly…
In my direction, you never question when I said I…
Will be a mogul before I visit Tupac and Left Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see ya we gon test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I’m on a red eye
Flying back to my city cause I forever stand by…

[Hook]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate, we can all harvest the rap artist of NWA
America target a rap market, it’s controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in, made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, 10 bottles of Rose
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every muthafucka in here say

Look who responsible for taking Compton international
I make ‘em holla oooooooh

Eh yo Just Blaze, good looking homie
(Just Blaze, just blaze)

Ain't no city quite like mine
