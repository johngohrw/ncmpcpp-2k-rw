[Hook: Swae Lee]
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat these hoes special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Swae Lee, Lee Swae, it's the same difference
H2O, lean, same thing
Niggas throw sets and gang bang
Free everybody in the chain gang
Been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on
Versace, them rings on, say my fucking name ho
Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah that old school mine fool
Never heard about you, all my hoes they so rude
Tats all on me nigga, trill ass individual
Don't check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her
Pink slip, no rental, got a L full of that killer
Beating on my chest like Magilla
Nigga, I am the gorilla of the village
Pack sound like heavy metal
Just killed the haters, God bless 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Young niggas got get to the money
Five chains on they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a 7 every time I shoot
She said, "why you have so many condoms with you?"
I said, "I'm a player to be honest with you"
Hublot, (Whoo!) so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than a nigga on a hang glider
4-5-6-7 chains on, just stay in your lane ho
Don't you like these A Wangs? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, on the loud singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em
