Promises Of EternityThe Magnetic FieldsWhat if the show couldn't go on?What if we all got jobs And got to bed before dawn?What if Old Joe had to retire?What if all the stage hands were let go or fired?That's just like what the world would be If you fell out of love with me I can't let this happen to you Don't you let it happen to me What would our friends and family say If they could only see If you let this happen to us Don't think you'd be setting me free Wasn't it you and I who made Promises of eternity What if the lights didn't go on?What if the velvet curtain had to be taken down?What if the clowns couldn't be clowns?And all those painted smiles gave in to plaintive frowns?What if no show ever happened again No Seven, no 8 1/2, no Nine, and no 10All numbers and no mystery No promise of eternity...I can't let this happen to you Don't you let it happen to me What would our friends and family say If they could only see If you let this happen to us Don't think you'd be setting me free Wasn't it you and I who made Promises of eternity[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/The_Magnetic_Fields:Promises_Of_Eternity ]
