Everybody's raised in blindness
Everybody knows it's true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anybody's point of view

Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same

Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real?
Can I be real? (Somebody real)

Hmmm, if it's all a vast creation
Putting on a face that's new
Someone has to see, a role for him and me
Someone might as well be you

Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Oh-oh, could we, could we make a star to snatch their angels, boy
Played your role for every day

Please help me
Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell apart, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I be real? Can I be?

Who can I be now? You found me
Who can I be? Fell upon, you found me
Now can I be now? You found me
Now can I, can I be real? Can I be real?
Can I be real? Can I be?
(Who) can I be?
Yeah, yeah
(Now) Yeah, can I be (now)?
You found me
(Now) can I be free?
Can I...
