Whoa
Whoa, one two

Out on the town
Lookin' for a woman
Gonna gimme good love
Anybody wanna hand off me
And give me plenty of
She was standin' alone
Over by the juke box
Like she'd some thing to sell
I said baby what's the goin' price
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Singles bar
Got my eye on a honey
Hangin' out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said baby
Drivin' me crazy
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy she's mine
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Hey you
Angus
Shoot me, shoot
That's nice
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Shoot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I don't need a thing
Don't wanna be
Shot down in flames
