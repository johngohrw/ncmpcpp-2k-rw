I'm feeling further, feeling further from you every day
You're in the stars, in the stars, yeah, you're worlds away
I'm moving on, moving on, then I hear you say
Hold on, hold on

We're losing light, losing light, yeah, we're fading fast
We had a fire, need a spark, or we'll never last
Just look at me, look at me, I've been burning for you
So long, so long

I should walk away

(Oh-oh oh-oh)
I look at you and (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I get the feeling (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I think that I should hold on, hold on

(Oh-oh oh-oh)
I look at you and (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I get the feeling (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I think that I should hold on, hold on

I'm losing love, losing you, losing everything
Losing faith in the world where I wanna be
So I don't care if the one thing that's killing me
Is so wrong, so wrong

I should walk away

(Oh-oh oh-oh)
I look at you and (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I get the feeling (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I think that I should hold on, hold on

(Oh-oh oh-oh)
I look at you and (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I get the feeling (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I think that I should hold on, hold on

Oh oh, oh oh

And I can't stop this feeling
And I can't stop this feeling

(Oh-oh oh-oh)
I look at you and (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I get the feeling (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I think that I should hold on, hold on

(Oh-oh oh-oh)
I look at you and (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I get the feeling (Oh-oh oh-oh)
I think that I should hold on, hold on
