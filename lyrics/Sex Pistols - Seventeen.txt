You're only 29
Got a lot to learn
But when your mummy dies
She will not return

We like noise, it's our choice
It's what we wanna do
We don't care about long hairs
I don't wear flares

See my face not a trace
No reality
I don't work, I just speed
That's all I need

I'm a lazy sod, I'm lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod, I'm so lazy
I'm a lazy sod, I'm lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod, I'm so lazy
I can't even be bothered
Lazy Lazy
