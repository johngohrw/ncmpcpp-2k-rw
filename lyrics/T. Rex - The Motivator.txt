I love the way you walk
Don't you know you're a cool motivator
Love the way you walk
Love the way you walk

I love the way your eye
It doth shine like an Egyptian ruby
Love the way it shines
Love the way it shines
Shine on

I love the clothes you wear
They're so mean they're so fine
Love the clothes you wear
Love the clothes you wear

I love the broken crown
The one you stole from the King
Love the broken crown
Love the broken crown
I love it

I love the golden cat
You know the one that you keep
In your bedroom
Love the golden cat
Love the golden cat

I love the velvet hat
You know the one that caused
A revolution
Love the velvet hat
Love the velvet hat
I love it
