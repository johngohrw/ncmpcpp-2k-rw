# ncmpcpp-2k-rw
foobar2000 UI theme based on ncmpcpp.

![alt text](https://imgur.com/eQqEArP.jpg "with switchable side panels!")

A custom theme for the foobar2000 music player. I completely ripped off the color scheme from the ncurses based MPD client (ncmpcpp) music player for UNIX systems, hence the name.

Written in 2015 during highschool. Obviously very badly written and badly maintained. Judge all you want.

## To-do
* clean up codebase to not include the foobar2k client itself, only files related to the theme.
* clean up unneccessary & unused script files derived from other themes.
* export a final clean fcl file.
