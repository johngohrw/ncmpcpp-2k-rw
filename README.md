# ncmpcpp-2k-rw
foobar2000 UI theme based on ncmpcpp.

![alt text](https://imgur.com/jlccap7.jpg "with switchable side panels!")

A custom theme for the foobar2000 music player. I ripped off the layout and color scheme from the ncurses based MPD client (ncmpcpp) music player for UNIX systems, hence the name.

Written in 2015 during highschool. Obviously very badly written and badly maintained. I don't recommend that you clone this unless you are familiar with foobar2000's theming system, Columns UI, and ES Playlist. You could download the .zip and use it on your own media library as it comes with the foobar2000 client, but the scrap files are still there. I would hope to clean up and re-release this as a true "theme" package that can be applied to your existing foobar configurations, in the future.

## To-do
* clean up codebase to not include the foobar2k client itself, only files related to the theme.
* clean up unneccessary scrap files & unused script files derived from other themes.
* export a final clean fcl file & related theme files.
